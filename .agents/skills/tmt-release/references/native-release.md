# Native release verification

Commands and gotchas for archive, installer, upgrade and bootstrap work. Cut, version
injection, exact-tag pipeline selection, publication gates and readback are in
[main-cuts.md](main-cuts.md); fixture builds for installation and upgrade proofs are in
[installation-fixtures.md](installation-fixtures.md). Policy and authorization live in
[SKILL.md](../SKILL.md): verification is never publication authorization, and ordinary
changes use the focused checks in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](../../../../DEVELOPMENT.md). Run from the repository root unless
stated. Raw runtime proof is in the
[smoke matrix](../../tmt-e2e/references/runtime-smoke-matrix.md); raw executables do not
prove archives or public installation.

## Native pipeline

The matching-host pipeline is `.github/workflows/native-release-bundle.yml`; exact-tag
dispatch, failed-draft recovery, publication gates and manual readback are owned by
[main-cuts.md](main-cuts.md). Cached packaging tools are keyed by OS, architecture and
exact tool versions and are developer tools only; Rust dependency caches are per product
and target and written by `main` only. cargo-dist merges the downloaded manifests
(`dist build --artifacts global --output-format=json --no-local-paths`): never hand-merge
artifact JSON. For the CLI pass a complete `dist plan` as bootstrap `--plan` so a missing
matrix target cannot shrink the release. Intel candidate verification fails closed without
the Rosetta tooling.

## Building and verifying archives

Install the pinned tools into a chosen directory: cargo-dist 0.32.0 (`cargo install --locked`)
and cargo-about 0.9.2 (`cargo install --locked --features cli`). Fetch locked dependencies
before the offline notice step. The taffy license clarification in `rust/about.toml` resolves
to `rust/licenses/taffy-0.7.7/LICENSE.md`; the builder fails if its bytes or the locked taffy
version change (review the clarification on a taffy upgrade). Select the CLI explicitly with
`--tag v<CLI-version>` for direct `dist plan`/`dist build` calls. Build targets sequentially in
one checkout (distribution directory and notice input are per checkout), retaining each
manifest, archive and notices before the next build:

```sh
scripts/build-native-artifact.sh --notices-only aarch64-apple-darwin squad     # notices only; not archive proof
native_manifest=$(mktemp)
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 scripts/build-native-artifact.sh aarch64-apple-darwin > "$native_manifest"
node typescript/scripts/verify-native-artifact.mjs --manifest "$native_manifest" \
  --archive target/distrib/tmt-cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --skill skills/tmux-team/SKILL.md --notices rust/target/native-notices/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt --license LICENSE
```

The verifier bounds inputs (64 MiB compressed, 128 MiB expanded), requires exactly the four
runtime files, runs the extracted executable with no Node/Rust/tmux on `PATH` and checks
SQLite persistence; macOS needs `otool` and `lipo` through `xcrun` (10 s bound), so every
workflow job that runs it on macOS first runs `.github/actions/warm-xcrun` (a guard test
fails otherwise); Linux needs `readelf`. A generated notice file is not legal certification.
`typescript/test/native/artifact.Dockerfile` builds a matching-architecture Linux musl image
(`TARGET_TRIPLE`, optional `--build-arg PRODUCT=<product>`, task-owned name, run with
`--rm --init --network none`); remove that image afterwards.

Negative archive tests use real tar fixtures: exercise checksum corruption, truncation,
missing executable/notices, links, unexpected paths, duplicates, bounds and cleanup, never
accepting an arbitrary process error as proof. The hard-link fixture uses synchronous tar
construction (the async packer's link queue can hang) and must assert a real `Link` entry.
Compare large executable buffers with `Buffer.equals`, not structural matchers (heap
exhaustion), and verify the comparator detects a changed byte. Installation cases use an
explicit 15 s subprocess budget for debug archive hashing.

### Squad archives

A Squad archive adds `skills/` copied from `extensions/tmt-squad/skills/` through the
package's cargo-dist `include` (a package list replaces the workspace list, so it repeats
the shared files); the installer inventories it from the checksum-verified archive.

```sh
scripts/build-native-artifact.sh aarch64-apple-darwin squad > /absolute/squad-manifest.json
node typescript/scripts/verify-native-artifact.mjs --product squad --manifest /absolute/squad-manifest.json \
  --archive target/distrib/tmt-squad-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --skills extensions/tmt-squad/skills \
  --notices rust/target/native-notices/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt --license LICENSE
```

Runtime proof runs `tmt-squad --version` and checks `tmt-squad skill show` prints the archived
`SKILL.md`, leaving an empty HOME and config. Then `tmt extension install squad --archive
<archive> --manifest <manifest> --prefix <task-owned-prefix> --channel alpha --yes`, a repeat
install and `tmt extension uninstall squad`.

### Herdr driver archives

`driver-herdr` is `release: false` in the component map and `dist = false` in its Cargo package
until owner-authorized activation (#1418) changes both for its first standalone alpha; the CLI archive
keeps shipping its binary until then. Build independently (no `tmt` build):

```sh
scripts/build-native-artifact.sh aarch64-apple-darwin driver-herdr > /absolute/driver-manifest.json
node typescript/scripts/verify-native-artifact.mjs --product driver-herdr --manifest /absolute/driver-manifest.json \
  --archive target/distrib/tmt-driver-herdr-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --notices rust/target/native-notices/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt --license LICENSE
node typescript/scripts/verify-native-driver-upgrade.mjs --product driver-herdr \
  --archive /absolute/new/tmt-driver-herdr-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --manifest /absolute/new/dist-manifest.json \
  --previous-archive /absolute/old/tmt-driver-herdr-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --previous-manifest /absolute/old/dist-manifest.json \
  --driver-archive /absolute/cli/tmt-cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --driver-manifest /absolute/cli/dist-manifest.json --target aarch64-apple-darwin
```

Build each version in task-owned source copies; never rewrite the implementation checkout or
share a Rust target directory. The standalone proof executes protocol capabilities with no
application state.

## Upgrade and installer verification

Installation and upgrade tests build their fixtures as described in
[installation-fixtures.md](installation-fixtures.md).

`tmt upgrade [--channel stable|alpha] [--to <version> | --unpin] [--json]` and `tmt update`
share one grammar. Use task-owned managed prefixes; an unmanaged checkout binary fails before
networking. Production has no test endpoint or TLS bypass: API fixtures inject only the
adapter's acquisition boundary and local TLS fixtures use test-only trust. Verify channel
discovery with injected responses only (more than 1,000 refs without a Link, complete
pagination, numeric alpha ordering, stable/alpha/beta/rc separation, tags without releases,
malformed or cross-endpoint pagination, page/byte/request exhaustion) and assert the
two-request common case and no release/asset request before complete ref discovery.
Incomplete discovery fails with `Release discovery exceeds its bound; select an exact version
with --to.` (`NATIVE_UPGRADE_FAILED`). Rate-limit fixtures: `cargo test --locked -p
tmt-adapters release_http`. Archive, handoff and typed grammar checks:
`cargo test --locked -p tmt-adapters native_install` and `... -p tmt-cli native_install`;
the [handoff contract](../../../../contracts/native-install-handoff-v1.md) owns the probe. A
timeout after installation starts is an uncertain outcome, never proof of rollback. Assert
active receipts and surviving executables, not only exit codes.

Actual-archive acceptance needs separately versioned matching-host artifacts built in
task-owned source copies (never alter the repository version or publish fixtures to test
updates). It is `#[ignore]` and selected explicitly by the CLI upgrade proof:

```sh
TMT_UPGRADE_OLD_ARCHIVE=/abs/old.tar.gz TMT_UPGRADE_OLD_MANIFEST=/abs/old.json \
TMT_UPGRADE_NEW_ARCHIVE=/abs/new.tar.gz TMT_UPGRADE_NEW_MANIFEST=/abs/new.json \
TMT_UPGRADE_TARGET=aarch64-apple-darwin CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 \
cargo +1.97.0 test --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p tmt-adapters --lib \
  native_install::upgrade::artifact_tests::cargo_dist_upgrade_refreshes_real_artifacts_and_preserves_conflicts \
  -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
node typescript/scripts/verify-native-installation.mjs --previous-archive "$previous_archive" --previous-manifest "$previous_manifest" \
  --archive "$next_archive" --manifest "$next_manifest" --target aarch64-apple-darwin --skill skills/tmux-team/SKILL.md
```

Require exactly one selected passing test. Identical embedded skill text prints a skipped
differential result; candidate-byte equality, conflict preservation and repair still run.
The installation verifier checks old/new versions with no runtime `PATH`, pinned rejection,
explicit `--unpin` advancement, retained executable, no-op, downgrade rejection, exact skill,
unchanged SQLite bytes and migration of state the previous release wrote. The
`native-release-upgrade.yml` proof (also `workflow_dispatch` from `main` for any draft or
published tag) does this on four hosts; extension and driver releases use
`verify-native-extension-upgrade.mjs` and `verify-native-driver-upgrade.mjs`. The first
release of a product has nothing to upgrade from and says so; a commit that predates the
scripts fails the proof with that message and is proven by hand.

Extension-upgrade proofs (`test/native/extension-upgrade-proof.test.ts`) use one native
recording driver on macOS and Linux; build it first and publish the built bytes through
`writeExecutable` (never a shell driver, a compile during a scenario, a relaxed Mach-O
inspection or a longer deadline). Both native-process CI scopes build it. The synthetic
driver archive's `NATIVE-INSTALL.md` holds fixture JSON with absolute `executable` and `log`
paths; it is fixture configuration, not shipped installation guidance.

```sh
cargo build --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p tmt-test-support --example recording-cli-fixture
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm exec vp test run --config test/native/vitest.config.ts test/native/extension-upgrade-proof.test.ts)
```

Offline composition (an internal entry point, not in help or completion), always with a
task-owned prefix and matching archive:

```sh
native_prefix=$(mktemp -d)
rust/target/debug/tmt __native-install --archive target/distrib/tmt-cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz \
  --manifest "$native_manifest" --prefix "$native_prefix" --channel alpha --json
"$native_prefix/bin/tmt" --version
```

`--pin`/`--unpin` change pin state, omission preserves it, and neither authorizes a downgrade.
Receipts written by v5.0.0-alpha.2 through alpha.6 record `wkh237/tmux-team`, which reading
still accepts.

Core also registers `remote` and `colab` for the shared installer (commands in
[tmt-remote](../../tmt-remote/SKILL.md#installer-registration)); synthetic archives prove
installer behavior, not published linkage.

## Curl bootstrap

Generate the script only after final archives and their independent runtime verification; the
manifest, not a hand-kept version table, owns the facts:

```sh
node typescript/scripts/generate-native-bootstrap.mjs --manifest /abs/dist-manifest.json --archive-dir /abs/artifacts > /abs/artifacts/tmt-installer.sh
sh -n /abs/artifacts/tmt-installer.sh
node typescript/scripts/verify-native-bootstrap.mjs --manifest /abs/dist-manifest.json \
  --archive /abs/artifacts/tmt-cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz --target aarch64-apple-darwin --skill skills/tmux-team/SKILL.md
```

The verifier needs real matching-host artifacts and replaces only curl acquisition; it is not
live GitHub or cross-target evidence. The Dockerfile above carries it too (`--entrypoint node`).
`test/tooling/native-bootstrap.test.ts` covers negative paths with a stub that is never
publication evidence. An authorized release uploads the exact verified manifest, archives and
script and verifies the public download before the README advertises it.

## Packed verifier cleanup

For `typescript/scripts/packed-command.mjs` changes run
`test/tooling/packed-command.test.ts` and `test/tooling/release-cut-live.test.ts` through `vp test run --config vitest.config.ts`, then
`pnpm check:tooling`. Keep the negative controls and original subprocess deadlines; the
[release boundary](../../../../ARCHITECTURE.md#release-boundary) owns termination.

## Conventional PR-title rollout

`Code quality` runs `node typescript/scripts/pr-title-check.mjs` only for `merge_group`: it
checks every pending squash subject (after removing GitHub's final `(#PR)`) against
`type(scope)?: subject` with a lowercase type, optional nonempty scope and `!`. It is syntax
feedback only; the cut planner owns release attribution. The mode is **report-only**:
findings (PR, SHA, escaped title) go to job output and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, and invalid
titles, unavailable queue evidence or summary I/O errors still exit zero (unavailable evidence
is never a clean result). A title edited after queue entry is not compared against REST, and
full CI has no `edited` trigger. Enforcement is a separate small PR whose cutover is the
report-only PR's actual `merged_at` plus 24 hours as an explicit UTC timestamp; no
clock-dependent flip or ruleset edit. Verify with
`pnpm exec vp test run --config vitest.config.ts test/tooling/pr-title-check.test.ts`,
`pnpm test:run`, `pnpm check` and `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Project release tracking

`project-release.yml` sweeps closed issue items (except `epic`) of
[pj-tmt project 1](https://github.com/orgs/pj-tmt/projects/1) and owns `Status` and
`Released in` for them; it needs **Organization projects: read and write** on the release App
token (main-only `release` Environment) and no PAT. The daily cron is 04:23 UTC, and
`native-release-bundle.yml` dispatches a full sweep after publication read-back and
successful smoke. After changing component eligibility or Rust production dependencies run the cut, component-scope and workflow tests (`test/tooling/release-cut.test.ts`, `ci-scope.test.ts`, `release-workflow.test.ts`); keep CI scope separate from release attribution (normal/build workspace dependencies follow the product binary through Cargo-resolved metadata). Avoid manual edits to those two fields during a live run. Product attribution
uses `ci-scope.releasedComponentsForPath` (`owns`/`excludes` plus each released package's
transitive Cargo normal/build workspace dependency directories; dev-only edges never
attribute) over `cargo-workspace.mjs::readCargoWorkspace(root, {runner})` (`cargo metadata
--offline --locked`, no Git logic); workflows run `cargo fetch --locked` from `rust/` first.
`release:false` alone is never evidence that work needs no release (Colab, Remote and Herdr
await activation); the map's `releaseStatus` is valid only with `release:false`: `never`
(test support, contained in no release) and `parked` (Office) reconcile to `Done`, anything
else stays `Merged`. Bounds per run:
200 GraphQL and 20 REST requests, 20 pages per connection, 2,000 merged closing PRs; every
GraphQL read reports `rateLimit`, and insufficient reserve aborts before any write. For
activation or a change, dry-run first and review the per-item table against the first live run:

```bash
gh api repos/pj-tmt/tmt/actions/workflows/project-release.yml/dispatches --method POST --input - <<'JSON'
{"ref":"main","inputs":{"dry_run":"true"}}
JSON
# After reviewing the table, repeat with dry_run=false.
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm exec vp test run --config vitest.config.ts test/tooling/project-release.test.ts test/tooling/cargo-workspace.test.ts test/tooling/release-attribution.test.ts test/tooling/release-cut.test.ts test/tooling/ci-scope.test.ts test/tooling/release-workflow.test.ts test/tooling/release-publish.test.ts)
actionlint .github/workflows/project-release.yml .github/workflows/native-release.yml .github/workflows/native-release-bundle.yml .github/workflows/native-release-smoke.yml
```

## Merge queue metrics

Read-only REST evidence (no GraphQL); bounds are UTC, start inclusive and end exclusive:

```sh
node typescript/scripts/merge-queue-metrics.mjs --repo pj-tmt/tmt \
  --since 2026-10-02T00:00:00Z --until 2026-10-02T08:08:40Z --boundary 2026-10-02T06:08:40Z \
  --cache /tmp/tmt-queue-metrics-cache --output /tmp/tmt-queue-metrics.md --json /tmp/tmt-queue-metrics.json
```

`--boundary` compares cohorts, `--details` prints all cost rows, `--offline` requires cached
evidence, `--max-requests N` overrides the 500-request budget (split capped windows),
`--workflow FILE` defaults to `ci.yml`, and repeated `--tag-pr N` overrides #961/#963. The
script and report state their methodology limits. Verify with
`pnpm exec vp test run --config vitest.config.ts test/tooling/merge-queue-metrics.test.ts`
from `typescript/`.
