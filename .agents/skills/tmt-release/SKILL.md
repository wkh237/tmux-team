# tmux-team release management

Use this skill for release-line maintenance, v4 compatibility fixes, v5 promotion, version synchronization, or prerelease readiness in this repository.

## Long-lived branch policy

- `main` is the active v5 line after promotion.
- `v4` is the maintenance line rooted at commit `7056679dfa816a1acef8e7c978cf1733a578115b`.
- If remote `v4` does not exist, create it at that exact anchor only when the user has explicitly requested the maintenance line, then verify the remote ref before continuing.
- Before any branch mutation, verify the relevant remote refs and ancestry. Never force-push or repoint a long-lived line.
- A v4 maintenance fix requires a tracked issue, a dedicated branch and worktree, and a reviewable pull request. Keep the fix on the v4 line unless an explicitly scoped backport is requested.
- Use the checks available on the v4 line for maintenance pull requests; do not require contexts that the target branch cannot produce. Record any coverage gap in the issue.
- The CLI version is owned by `rust/Cargo.toml` and exposed through Cargo's package version; there is no TypeScript fallback. Keep any retained developer package version and public release instructions consistent when changing versions. The native skill ships with the CLI; there is no separately versioned plugin or marketplace.
- Follow `AGENTS.md` for GitHub issue state, branch and pull-request links, verification evidence, and safe worktree cleanup.

## Release-cut shadow migration

Follow the [architecture's shadow contract](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md#release-cut-shadow)
and [verification procedure](references/native-release.md#release-cut-shadow)
for #1399. Shadow computation and the read-only native injection check confer no
publication, release/tag mutation, owner-hold override or workflow-dispatch
authorization. Preserve the active release path and its gates until the separately
reviewed switch; authorization below continues to apply.

## Private-leaf attribution

The component map's `releaseConsumers` attributes private TUI, CLI style and invoke changes to Squad.
The release workflow's small `release-please-run.mjs` wrapper adds only in-memory consumer paths
before release-please's splitter and cutoffs; 17.11.2 has no `additional-paths` config option.
Style and invoke retain CLI attribution; TUI retains its CLI exclusion. Project release evidence
uses `ci-scope.releasedComponentsForPath` to retain released-root membership alongside leaf consumers
and the Cargo normal/build workspace closure. Read it through the shared
`cargo-workspace.mjs` reader against the caller's chosen checkout; dev-only dependencies
never contribute. ARCHITECTURE owns the reader and explicit private-delivery marker
contract; DEVELOPMENT owns its checks and cache preparation.
The generator requires
reviewed consumption declarations for all external production workspace links of a declared consumer,
using its existing Cargo metadata graph, including transitive dependencies.
Keep its pinned API shape verified by tooling tests loading the release job's isolated install.
Follow the [generator and real-candidate checks](references/native-release.md#tooling-prerequisites) before changing this consumption rule
or upgrading release-please. This does not change publication authorization or private-leaf version ownership.

## Release PR safety

Release PRs must pass `Code quality`'s notes gate before merge: compare from the
component's newest published tag, with every linked commit inside its ancestry
range through the candidate base. COVERAGE requires a link for every commit the
pinned release-please renderer lists for the component in that range. Use its
parser, path splitter, exclusions and private-leaf attribution with the
candidate-base config's changelog sections or pinned defaults; do not introduce
a second visible-type list or entry-count policy. Missing links hold the merge
group until release-please refreshes the notes on a main push.
The cumulative merge-group selector
keeps existing locked Cargo workers selected for earlier pending release changes.
A visible matching manifest draft without its git tag holds only that component’s
release PR candidate; unheld components regenerate normally. Only all-held
manifest paths skip `release-pr`; `github-release` and draft processing continue. Missing or inconsistent evidence
fails closed. [The release PR gate notes](references/native-release.md#release-pr-gates-queue-and-stall-monitor)
own draft-token visibility, bounded REST discovery, fixtures and recovery procedures. Neither gate
authorizes manual tagging, release editing or publication.

## Release queue robustness

The release workflow runs `github-release` first, then the fresh tagless-draft REST
check, queue preparation/dequeue and `release-pr`, then enables at most one
same-repository main release PR. This clears merged untagged PRs before the pinned
release-please attempts PR updates; the draft check must include drafts created
in this run. A failed `github-release` stops the job and reports that `release-pr`
was not attempted. Keep the
queue pre-check's `skip`/`run`/`blocked` interface and its live-only `enable` command in
the single queue owner; complete paginated discovery and head-pinned enabling must fail
visibly on uncertainty. Skip a queued release PR only when `checkReleaseNotes` accepts
its notes against main HEAD; keep coverage in that safety owner. Invalid compare anchors, out-of-range links or missing COVERAGE links require one
bounded live dequeue with the release App token, after rechecking the PR identity,
head and queue entry, before release-pr refreshes the notes. Dry runs never dequeue.
Tagless-draft-held candidates retain their queue entry and existing generation filter.
Failed or unverified dequeue writes a recovery summary and blocks release-pr and
queue enabling after github-release, while downstream draft processing continues;
initial acquisition errors still fail visibly. Fetch full history and tags with Code quality's
checkout pattern. Do not enable another component while a release PR is enabled
or queued. Existing workflow concurrency serializes this policy, not external enqueues.

Keep `always-update` for conflict recovery and the pinned update wrapper's unchanged
release-content comparison for CI continuity. BEHIND alone does not require a branch
refresh: the merge queue runs required checks against current main's merged result.
Changed release content still needs fresh checks; no queue priority jump is used.
[The queue notes](references/native-release.md#release-pr-gates-queue-and-stall-monitor)
owns request bounds, failure and recovery details. Tooling tests must cover pagination,
single-active selection, queued covered/stale notes against main HEAD, dequeue-before-refresh ordering,
failed dequeue after completed github-release and suppressed queue enabling, identity/head races, dry-run non-mutation, unchanged generated files and original conflict/update behavior.

## Release stall monitoring

Keep advisory stall detection separate from required release gates. The pinned
manifest remains the releasability owner; a monitor must not close its issue on
incomplete evidence or mutate held release PRs. Keep `issues: write` for monitoring
in its separate job; its REST uses `github.token`. Only the existing
release-job App reader sees drafts, passing metadata rather than credentials.
Distinguish historical anonymous-smoke infrastructure issues from current check failures;
a rate-limit issue recommends retrying smoke, never publication. Preserve zero-failure behavior,
visible summary warnings and fixture-only REST tests. [The monitor
notes](references/native-release.md#release-pr-gates-queue-and-stall-monitor) owns thresholds,
credentials, bounded discovery and the single-issue recovery lifecycle.

## Conventional PR titles

Merge groups report conventional squash-title syntax through the shared safety
owner. The report-only phase writes findings and unavailable evidence to job
output/summary and always exits zero; it does not enforce titles yet. Do not add
an `edited` trigger to full CI or compare ordinary queued subjects against mutable
REST titles. [The rollout notes](references/native-release.md#release-pr-gates-queue-and-stall-monitor)
owns the observation day and the separate explicit UTC cutover, 24 hours after
the report-only PR merges. Keep release-please as the release attribution and
changelog owner.

## Project release reconciliation

Keep delivery evidence separate from publication: the Project updater derives
closed-issue fields from merged closing PRs, changed-path product ownership and
the earliest published containing tag for every affected product. Use the existing
component map and release policy/version helpers, never notes or a recency window.
Every sweep is authoritative for eligible issues, including recovery from built-in
status workflow writes. Exclude epic trackers from both fields; their owning lead
retains the acceptance/dogfood gate, and the summary lists them as skipped. The post-publication dispatch waits for read-back and smoke completion;
authenticated acquisition errors remain failures, with the daily sweep retaining publication reconciliation.
Retain the daily safety net. Follow [Project release tracking
procedure](references/native-release.md#project-release-tracking) for full dry-run table
review, request and GraphQL point-cost reporting, exact verification commands and
activation evidence.
A tracking dispatch never authorizes publication or a publishing-workflow replay.

## Promotion and prerelease checks

Read the complete [native release verification reference](references/native-release.md)
before archive, installer, upgrade, bootstrap or publication work. It owns the
procedures referenced below; [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../../DEVELOPMENT.md) owns ordinary native checks.

For packed verifier process-runner changes, follow the
[packed cleanup checks](references/native-release.md#packed-verifier-cleanup).
Preserve its real absence and surviving-group controls; synthetic fixture success
does not authorize publication or replace artifact acceptance.

- For Rust archives, follow the guide's native Rust release archive procedure.
  Generate the offline clarification config before calling cargo-about directly,
  as documented there; keep its vendored-license checksum and version checks,
  `--fail` and the archive verifier's placeholder rejection intact.
  Keep cargo-dist's manifest as the artifact metadata owner; independently verify
  bounded extraction, notices, linkage, skill installation and persisted state.
  Raw PR runtime checks do not establish release archive correctness. Do not enable a
  generated installer or publication workflow merely to obtain local archives.
- Follow the native runtime checks and the reference's archive verification for artifact changes.
  For fixture-only archive-policy fixes, follow the reference's negative archive checks
  for hard-link construction and rejection controls.
  Reuse the shared runtime proof for linkage, exact embedded skills and SQLite
  reopen behavior. Keep the independent archive inventory/checksum/notices and
  installer failure/cleanup evidence; raw binaries are not release artifacts.
- For native binary publication changes, also follow the guide's offline
  installer lifecycle procedure using actual separately versioned archives.
  Keep ownership anchored in the installation prefix, not application-state
  selectors; verify old executable preservation, pin policy, partial command-link
  finalization and unchanged data. The internal preview entrypoint is not a
  public bootstrap or permission to replace a user/package-manager installation.
- Promotion requires passing Code quality, Unit tests, and Docker E2E checks.
- For a public native alpha, follow the guide's explicit multi-platform
  release preparation procedure. A `prepare` run of the manual artifact workflow never
  publishes;
  all four final native verifiers must pass on the recorded reviewed commit.
  Keep cargo-dist as the merged manifest owner. Authorized publication uses an
  immutable draft-to-published GitHub release and verifies its attestation and
  public installer before promoting README instructions. Publish with the
  bundle's `release-publication.json` flags: the CLI release is a normal release
  marked latest (the README's `releases/latest/download/install.sh` depends on
  it); Office, Squad and Herdr driver releases stay prereleases with `--latest=false`. After
  a manual publication, run the guide's `--check-latest` check (the pipeline checks
  its own publications). Do not equate a
  downloadable CI bundle with a published or accepted release.
- Every CLI, extension or driver release also passes the guide's upgrade from the last
  published release using the product-specific proof in the reference, not only a
  fresh install. Old CLI/extension receipts must stay readable.
  The pre-publication CLI proof requires installation, migration and real-archive
  acceptance of the release's own adapter on all four hosts. Follow the guide's
  distinction between injected acquisition, skipped differential skill coverage for identical text,
  older-source rerun applicability and separate public installer/upgrade smoke.
  A standalone driver uses previous/candidate archives and the current published
  CLI's path approval surface. Herdr remains parked until release cut (#1399)
  activates it, as the reference documents.
- For curl bootstrap, follow the guide's native curl bootstrap verification.
  Generate from final verified cargo-dist artifacts and invoke the existing
  native publisher; do not enable a competing stock installer. Test an actual
  matching-host archive without Node/Rust on runtime PATH, and distinguish
  controlled-download evidence from an authorized public release smoke test.
  npm/pnpm replacement is a fresh installation without data-transfer machinery,
  not permission to delete old state or silently uninstall another manager.
- Tags, GitHub Releases, npm publishing, and npm dist-tags are separate operations that require explicit authorization; this skill never assumes permission for them. The one standing authorization is the release pipeline's alpha publication below.
- Update user-facing installation or channel documentation whenever a version change would make it inaccurate.
- The v5 root npm package is private developer tooling, not a product distribution.
  Do not restore npm publishing or a download wrapper without a separately scoped
  distribution decision. Historical v4 publishing uses that branch's own rules.

## Archive contents and install facts

Colab's single-executable packaging route is prepared, with its app embedded by
the Colab-owned `TMT_COLAB_APP_DIR` build boundary and frontend notices appended
to Rust notices. Embedding (#1421) and core registration (#1423) are implemented.
It remains parked: a published supporting CLI alpha and actual-archive acceptance
precede separately authorized activation. Follow [Colab packaging verification](../tmt-colab/references/development.md#packaging-and-archives)
for fixture-only proof versus real archive/public-install evidence; do not treat
a tiny embedded-app fixture as delivery of the Colab product.

- Every product archive (CLI, Office, Squad) carries its executable, `LICENSE`,
  `NATIVE-INSTALL.md` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`. The installer enforces this
  inventory (`tmt-core`'s `native_install/product.rs`), so adding, renaming or
  dropping an entry is an installer-contract change with an upgrade proof, not a
  documentation edit. The CLI release may also carry optional companion executables.
- The archive's `NATIVE-INSTALL.md` is sourced from `rust/archive/NATIVE-INSTALL.md`
  through `dist-workspace.toml` and the Squad package include. Keep it a short,
  product-neutral offline note without version numbers: user guidance belongs to the
  handbook, and the onboarding test runs the note's PATH block in Bash and Zsh.
- Release targets are macOS x64/arm64 (build deployment target 11.0) and Linux
  x64/arm64 with a static musl runtime. macOS x64 follows the
  [runtime acceptance policy](../tmt-e2e/references/runtime-smoke-matrix.md):
  cross-build on arm64, complete Rosetta verifier process trees with exact
  installed-byte architecture checks, plus weekly native Intel public
  installation and upgrade coverage. A deployment target is not testing on every
  macOS version; cite the release's verification evidence for tested hosts.
- The manifest's SHA-256 checksums detect corruption, not a compromised download
  origin. Locally generated checksums are not signatures, and no local test artifact
  carries a GitHub attestation. Only a published immutable release does
  (`gh release verify`, `gh release verify-asset`).
- The generated `install.sh` fixes the initial version and channel (never a mutable
  tag). It verifies the manifest and archive sizes and digests before it runs the
  temporary binary, then delegates permanent writes to the native installer. It does
  not edit shell profiles or touch SQLite, and it needs only a POSIX shell, curl,
  tar/gzip, standard utilities and `sha256sum` or `shasum`. Its receipts record
  local-archive verification, not independent attestation provenance.
- Successful human installer output names `<requested-prefix>/bin/tmt`, matching the
  bootstrap summary even when a prefix ancestor is a symlink. Installation
  validation, receipts and JSON reports keep canonical paths (#1098).

## Automated alpha publication

The owner chose a trunk-based alpha channel: there is no separate edge channel, and a merge to
`main` publishes an alpha release through the release pipeline once its publication gates pass
(the owner's decisions on #497). That choice is the owner's standing authorization for **the
pipeline** to publish alpha releases from `main`; it is recorded here so that the written rule
matches practice. The
[native release verification reference](references/native-release.md) owns the
gates, the markers and the procedures; this section owns who may publish what.

- Covered: an alpha draft of the CLI, Office or Squad (a version `X.Y.Z-alpha.N`, enforced by
  the `channel` gate and again by the publish command) that the pipeline built from `main`,
  verified and attached, of a component that is released (`release: false` in the component map
  parks one), and that passes every publication gate. A new SQLite migration does not hold an
  alpha: migrations are forward-only, and the `migration` gate only reports the new entries in
  its summary. The CLI alpha is published as a
  normal release marked latest; Office and Squad alphas as prereleases with `--latest=false`,
  as the bundle's `release-publication.json` says.
- Still the owner's explicit authorization: stable releases and anything outside the alpha
  channel; a release from a branch line; a draft that any gate holds, and in particular a
  breaking change (a `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` commit), which always pauses for the owner's
  explicit OK;
  README installer promotion; creating or rotating the release App credentials and the
  `release` Environment (the owner's setup is in the guide's release-please section);
  enabling or changing release immutability; and this authorization itself.
- The authorization belongs to the pipeline, not to an agent. An agent still never tags,
  creates, edits or publishes a release by hand, and never dispatches a run that publishes,
  without the owner's explicit authorization for that release. A run of `native-release.yml`
  with `prepare` off publishes every draft of the product that passes its gates, and so does
  its `hold` input for the released draft; `prepare` on (one bundle, no draft), `release.yml`
  with `dry_run` on and the upgrade proof are not publication.
- A held draft carries `publication-held.json` with the gate, the reason and the run. Read it,
  then follow the guide: the owner publishes by hand, or releases the hold by dispatch, which
  skips only the gate the marker names. An owner-authorized `rerun` instead re-proves
  every gate with current main tooling against the draft's existing assets and its
  release-source expectations and adapter code, preserving the marker on failure
  and removing it only after all pass.
  `rerun` requires the owner's explicit authorization, like `hold`.
- After it publishes, the pipeline reads the release back (public, immutable, the policy's
  flags, the tag on the release commit, GitHub's attestation for the release and every asset).
  A failed check opens an issue and fails the run; nothing is rolled back, and a repair is a new
  reviewed version. A read-only smoke then installs the published release through the public
  installer (and `tmt upgrade` for the CLI) in an isolated environment on the four hosts, and a
  real failure there is reported on the same issue. The shared public-install-smoke
  action uses the workflow's `contents: read` `GITHUB_TOKEN` for native API acquisition.
  Pass it through env only, never argv or disk; redact output and verify isolated
  installed state contains no credential. Asset downloads remain public and token-free.
  Preserve the native bounded HTTPS retry and the bounded older-alpha latest-installer
  lag retry. Exhausted rate limits are ordinary failed smoke checks; there is no
  deferred rate-limit retry workflow. Use the PR-only four-host proof against existing
  published releases for tooling changes, never a publishing dispatch. Keep the
  post-publication Project dispatch gated on successful smoke and historical failure issues
  visible to the release monitor. Never dispatch publication to recover a smoke failure.
