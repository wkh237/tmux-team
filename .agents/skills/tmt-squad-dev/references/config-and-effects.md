# Squad configuration and effects

## `squad.toml` reading and writing

- `squad.toml` sits beside the global config that `tmt config show` reports. It is the
  user's file; agents never write it.
- `Config::write` owns format-preserving replacement for `me`/`me_id`, tab order, board
  views, theme bases and settings edits. It checks the original bytes, edits a cloned
  document, skips unchanged bytes and assigns the new document only after successful
  publication. A changed file is refused, not overwritten. The byte check plus atomic
  replacement is not a locking transaction, and no backups are created. Every named
  `Config::set_*`/`remove_*` edit goes through it.
- Source-bearing readers (`config::sourced`) carry provenance; presentation never
  inspects TOML or resolves values. `config::duration` converts UTF-8-safe whole-unit
  suffixes for provider, refresh and reminder timing; callers keep their own units,
  ranges and error messages, and only refresh wraps `"off"`.
- Layering (`Config` readers): the workflow layout comes from `Config::resolve_layout`,
  the one decision shared by the layout and board readers. Squads with no layout key use
  `team` unless they set the simple board form, which keeps `crew`; explicit `crew`,
  `pr-queue` and `minimal` keep their presets. `Config::board` resolves a hand-written
  per-squad `board.layout` or `panes` first, then per-squad `board.view`, then top-level
  `board.view`, then the workflow layout's own arrangement. A user `rows` or legacy
  `columns` table replaces the grid; `fields.<name>` replaces that provider's whole
  table (extra provider names keep `pr`); reminder keys override individually. A nested
  board requires a full `layout` or `panes` override, and partial `direction`/`sizes`
  overrides are rejected.
- `Config::refresh`: per squad, then top-level `[board]`, then `DEFAULT_REFRESH` (5 s);
  `None` is off. `config::TokenRate` layers the team preset, global `[board.token_rate]`
  and per-squad keys; only Team defaults on.
- Strict validation happens before raw mode: pane/fold keys, `hidden_columns`, theme
  tokens, state entries, bindings and configured views are rejected with located config
  errors, including masked values that no current view would use.

## Team preset

The `team` preset uses the same `Layout`/`Board::preset` and config readers as the
others: a 60/40 top-bottom split, rows beside detail/replies at 62/38 on top, detail
above replies at 50/50, full-width lead notes beneath, crew states, pending-first order,
a member/state/task/pr/model grid with a pending line, a 60-second `github-pr` field and
a 30-minute observed-age default. Everything is configurable; the other presets keep
their defaults. Model reads the existing session projection and providers stay on the
shared fetcher path.

## Views (pane arrangements)

- The `view` command module owns the factory catalog and registers `view ls` (hidden
  `list` alias), `set` and `rm`; bare `view` lists. `team`, `focus`, `notes`, `detail`
  and `wide` supply arrangements and initial fold settings only; the team workflow reads
  the same factory arrangement. A view changes no states, rows, providers, reminders or
  meter policy. Explicit per-squad fold settings override factory defaults through the
  same Board reader; pane acquisition reads the resolved Board independently of the
  workflow layout. `wide` folds its middle column below 180 cells and relies on the
  solver's 40:30 redistribution; there is no width-dependent arrangement resolver.
- `Config::set_view`/`remove_view` edit only `view` in the chosen board layer. A scoped
  set refuses a hand-written layout with a manual-removal hint; reset keeps custom keys,
  and drops only a table that the reset emptied when its header has no comments.
  All-boards choices stay masked by custom or scoped arrangements.
- The bindable `view` verb (`l`) opens `board::view_picker`, mirroring the theme picker's
  scope, navigation and save/cancel lifecycle. The opening Config is the save baseline and
  refresh never replaces that draft. `App::effective_board` is the single presentation
  accessor for preview geometry, fold defaults and focus; per-tab `FoldState` keeps session
  overrides. Esc restores the opening Board and focus with the latest data and writes
  nothing; a successful save uses the normal changed-Board fold reconciliation. A custom
  arrangement previews in this-squad scope on a disposable Config copy, but scoped save
  refuses to remove hand-written keys; in all-boards scope a custom squad keeps its Board,
  shows the masking note and saves the global view for other tabs. The reset entry removes
  only the chosen layer's `view` key. The Reload request carries `preview_panes` only while
  the picker is open, loading missing notes/replies through the same loader and
  cancellation fence; closing it returns to resolved-pane acquisition. Built-in leads/all
  tabs keep their fixed composition throughout and offer all-boards scope only.

## Themes

- The `theme` module registers `theme ls` (hidden `list` alias), `set` and `rm`; bare
  `theme` lists. Lists and the picker take names and descriptions from
  `tmt-cli-style::Base`, never a Squad palette. The effective base is `default`, `cli`,
  `board` or `squad`; token overrides resolve independently.
- `Config` reads core's resolved appearance through public `config show`, then applies
  `[board.theme]` and `[squad.<name>.theme]` through `look::board_theme`. Invalid core
  appearance falls back to the built-in base with a notice; invalid Squad layers are
  configuration errors, validated per layer including masked values.
- `Config::set_theme_base`/`remove_theme_base` change only `base`. Squad never writes
  `config.json`, and command and picker text say that CLI colors stay unchanged.
- The bindable `theme` action (`T` in both host presets and the all tab) opens
  `board::theme_picker`. The session reads its Config at opening and keeps that baseline
  across refreshes. Preview applies the same in-memory edit as CLI set, cached by
  selection and scope, without writing; `App::look` supplies it to every pane and tab. Tab
  switches board/squad scope (built-in tabs have board scope only; a masking squad base is
  named). Overlay input cannot operate underlying rows, tabs or panes. Enter calls the
  named edit once; a failed save keeps the draft and notice without retry; Esc drops the
  preview and uses the latest saved view.

## Settings inspection and editing

- `settings` coordinates arrangement, rows, notebook/state, meter, theme and tab/program
  projections. `config show` and the bindable inspection overlay (comma by default) share
  those results; the overlay owns its scroll position, blocks underlying input and keeps
  its opening snapshot through refresh (close/reopen reads later configuration). Provider
  argv, run bindings, state patterns and nested split structures are read-only, and neither
  inspection nor edit validation ever executes configured programs. `Config::bindings_for_tab`, `action::effective_bindings`
  and `tab_view::rows` keep inspection and loaded tab/section rules together. Aggregate
  tabs show fixed grids and global appearance without squad providers. `config show`
  without scope inspects board defaults; `--squad` and `--tab` are exclusive.
- Editing in the overlay (`board/settings.rs`): an editable entry opens a local input
  prompt. Each valid value calls `Config::preview_setting`, and the app applies the
  disposable board, rows, notes mode, state colors, interval and tab policy to the newest
  acquired data; the loader keeps raw core squad order so clearing tab order previews the
  same fallback as a reload. Invalid input leaves no draft. Esc restores the opening
  configuration and focus without discarding refreshed rows. Enter saves only through
  `Config::set_setting`, then refreshes values and sources; a file conflict stays in the
  prompt and never replaces concurrent edits. While the overlay is open the ordinary loader
  acquires preview notes/replies and metadata behind its existing cancellation fence, and
  closing returns to resolved-pane acquisition.
- `config::edit` owns the shared edit policy and a disposable validated Config draft.
  `sq config set KEY VALUE` accepts layout preset, flat split panes/direction/sizes,
  refresh, notes mode, hidden tracks, exact state colors, global tabs order/hide and the
  selected squad's reminder enable/threshold (booleans `true`/`false`, thresholds through
  the `Config::reminders` whole `s`/`m`/`h` validation, 1 m–24 h); arrays use JSON. Structural edits of a nested split tree refuse rather than flatten a
  custom or factory tree. Partial flat edits keep the workflow preset and seed missing flat
  split keys from the resolved arrangement. The draft runs the existing area validators,
  then `Config::set_setting` calls only the `Config::write` compare-and-set path; a changed
  file is refused and comments, order and unrelated keys survive. CLI edits touch no roster
  or member metadata, install no provider hooks and grant no extension consent. A reminder
  preview reclassifies only known ages in memory from the board's newest
  `staleness::Snapshot` (disabled previews remove marks; unknown ages stay unknown) and does
  no observation, cache publication or reminder claim; confirmed edits reach the shared
  observer on the ordinary reload.
- `board::help` projects navigation, effective bindings and meter explanations into
  `tmt-tui::components::KeyHelp` sections; `Action::description` owns binding wording for
  help and settings, while settings keep their literal JSON value and source apart from
  presentation prose. Meter input keeps observed roster names (including the lead and
  members omitted from displayed rows) for excluded labels.

## Actions and effects

- `action` parses `[bind]` and `[squad.<name>.section.bind]` once per load into events and
  actions whose arguments are templates; bad events, actions or field syntax are config
  errors. The board resolves the selected row's section binding, then `[bind]`, then the
  host preset (tmux: Enter and double-click jump; plain terminal: they open the row's
  action menu) into a fully filled request before anything runs; a missing value is a
  notice, never a partial action. One parser/dispatcher owns `toggle <pane>...`.
- `effects` holds the row actions behind plain `jump`, `open` and `copy` and the board.
  `template` fills `{field}` placeholders into one value and refuses empty values.
  Programs run as argv, never through a shell: the top-level `opener` and `clipboard`
  arrays, or the system opener. An opener starts in its own process group with null stdio
  and a reaper thread. `run` fills one argv element per template (refusing a value that
  would start an argument with `-`) and starts it the same way.
- Copy prefers the configured program; inside tmux it then uses
  `tmux -S <invoker socket> load-buffer -w -`, where `-V` must report 3.2 or later and
  `show -sv set-clipboard` decides whether the text reached the clipboard or only a buffer;
  otherwise it writes OSC 52 to `/dev/tty`.
- `jump` checks membership and calls `tmt focus`; Squad has no focus logic of its own.
  `jump --lead` finds the squad from `--squad`, else the caller's identity (`tmt whoami`) in
  exactly one roster, else the only squad, and jumps to that roster's lead; no lead is a
  refusal before any focus.
- `back` keeps a disposable stack per tmux server and client
  (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tmt-squad/back`, 0700, atomic replacement, `LIMIT` 32 entries; corrupt
  or foreign files read as empty). Every jump pushes the pane the client left, under the
  client `tmt focus` reports; `back` asks core for the invoker's client with
  `tmt focus --client`, pops its entry and focuses it.
- `send` uses public commands only: detached `talk --identity <sender> --room squad-<name>`
  with operands after `--`; annotations as a talk tagged `[<squad> · <row>]`; answers as one
  `tmt answer <member> --request <id>` (core selects and proves the request, no receipt
  passes through Squad); nothing acknowledges. Squad has no talk, reply or replies commands:
  those words refuse before parsing with the core command that replaces them.
- `hotkeys` generates `squad.tmux.conf` (bindings noted `tmt squad popup|pane|back|lead`;
  the optional lead key's `run-shell` job has `TMUX` but no `TMUX_PANE`, so it passes
  `TMUX_PANE=#{pane_id}` for core to name the caller) and owns one `source-file` line in
  the user's tmux configuration. It edits that file only after consent, rereads it before
  publication, keeps a byte-exact backup and replaces it atomically with the original mode;
  removal drops only the exact owned line. A linked configuration is resolved (at most eight
  hops, each relative to the link's real directory) and written beside its real file;
  dangling or looping links are refused before consent. Bindings record the first `tmt` on
  PATH that resolves to the running executable, not the release path. Collisions and
  ownership on the running server come from `list-keys -N -P "" -T prefix` (notes) and
  `list-keys -T prefix` (commands), since `list-keys -F` postdates tmux 3.2; Squad unbinds
  only keys whose note is its own. `board --popup` ends the session after a successful jump.

## Playbooks

Optional playbooks (`tmt squad playbook ls|show|install|rm`, first `tmux-squad`) live in
`extensions/tmt-squad/playbooks/`, deliberately not under `skills/`: the release archive
ships and the extension installer offers every skill under `skills/`, while a playbook is
installed only on request, and a test pins that no playbook is in that tree. `playbook.rs`
holds the one catalog of embedded sources and registers the subtree through `tmt-cli-style`.
`show` prints the exact bytes; `install` asks (the same `consent` helper as `hotkeys`), then
calls `skills.install` as owner `squad`; `rm` calls `skills.remove` with the playbook's name,
so the lead skill and `tmt extension rm squad` are unaffected. Squad never writes a provider
directory and never executes a playbook. The lead skill source is embedded only in the squad
executable, never in the core skill bundle.
