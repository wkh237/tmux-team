# TMT end-to-end testing

Use this skill for the repository's Docker E2E test foundation. Keep E2E tests separate from unit tests and unit-test coverage: Docker provides isolation, while Vitest is the scenario runner and assertion layer.

## Required test boundary

- Exercise the real `tmt`/`tmux-team` CLI and a real tmux server.
- Run deterministic mock agents inside tmux panes; never invoke a real AI agent, model, credential, or network service.
- Never touch the host user's tmux server, host credentials, or unrelated processes. The container must be network-isolated.
- Reuse the existing E2E harness and its cleanup hooks. Every scenario must leave its temporary tmux server, socket, panes, and files cleaned up, including on assertion failure.
- For lifecycle or cleanup changes, run the Docker suite twice to catch leaked state and non-idempotent teardown.
- Docker selects its built Rust CLI by default; mock replies inherit that selection.
  Verify the default path as well as fail-closed invalid selectors. Host test
  selection defaults to the repository-built native executable and must never
  discover an installed host CLI or fall back to a retired runtime.

## Test quality gate

Do not optimize for a passing suite or a larger test count. Every scenario must name the concrete regression risk or invariant it covers, and a reviewer should be able to explain what realistic defect would make it fail.

- Cover distinct boundaries and failure modes instead of repeating equivalent happy paths.
- Exercise the subject under test rather than recreating its logic in the harness. Mock agents are allowed because they are deterministic peers; `tmt` and tmux themselves stay real.
- Assert causal output and durable state. Terminal-echoed input is not proof that a mock agent processed a request; wait for agent-produced output and corroborate it with the structured event log or metadata.
- Keep observation independent of the action being scheduled. Request-service reads can trigger housekeeping; use read-only SQL/repository snapshots when proving cleanup ordering, expiry, or state preservation. Compare original stored messages separately from composed/protected transport text.
- Include negative paths for exit-code propagation, invalid operations, timeouts, partial startup, and thrown scenario errors when those risks are relevant.
- Use bounded polling for observable state changes. Do not use fixed sleeps to hide races or make a flaky scenario appear stable.
- Verify state preservation after failed operations and verify cleanup with observable absence, not only by calling a cleanup function.
- Prefer stable JSON fields, exit codes, pane IDs, metadata, and essential output over incidental formatting.
- Identity scenarios must choose lifetime deliberately: plain `name`/`add` is
  temporary; use `-s` only when persistence is part of the scenario. Global
  listing includes offline saved rows but does not expand cross-server routing.
  Correlate public UUID/lifetime with the existing read-only identity SQL oracle.
  If reconciliation refreshes `last_verified_at`, exclude only that field from
  preservation comparisons and validate its timestamp separately; retain every
  other binding field. Grouped pane presentation follows inventory selection,
  which need not match `display-message`'s chosen linked session.
- Keep foundation tests focused on infrastructure invariants. Add feature semantics only through the issue that defines that feature's state matrix.
- Treat a test that can pass without the intended action occurring as a test bug. Fix false positives before expanding coverage.

## Maintained implementation

Read the relevant files before changing behavior:

- [`test/e2e/`](../../../test/e2e/): Vitest configuration, scenarios, harness, and mock-agent behavior.
- [`scripts/run-e2e.mjs`](../../../scripts/run-e2e.mjs): Docker build/run wrapper and exit-code handling.
- [`DEVELOPMENT.md#selecting-the-cli-under-test`](../../../DEVELOPMENT.md#selecting-the-cli-under-test):
  shared executable/peer descriptors and container-path requirements. Reuse
  `test/support/cli-executable.mjs`; never add a hard-coded Node launcher or
  silent TS fallback. Prove selection reaches nested replies and real descendants
  with causal results. Historical TypeScript worker/pack tests are retired;
  their retained native guarantees are mapped in RUST-REWRITE.md.
- Keep retained native/E2E helpers under `test/support/`, independent of the old
  TypeScript product. Historical SQLite migration inputs and reference results
  live in `test/fixtures/storage-history/`; preserve their provenance, integrity
  checks and independent SQL assertions. Never use the native implementation to
  regenerate its own expected migration results. Keep stopped-schema public reply
  coverage on schema 8 rather than substituting an already-current database.
- [`PERFORMANCE-BASELINE.md`](../../../PERFORMANCE-BASELINE.md) for optional runtime
  measurements. Use the same isolated fixture and causal assertions; keep timing
  samples out of ordinary CI thresholds and distinguish measured from unavailable
  process resources. A skipped benchmark is not native parity evidence.

Keep orchestration in the wrapper and scenario assertions in Vitest. Do not duplicate harness or mock-agent implementation in this skill.

## Scope guard

This foundation covers CLI/tmux integration scenarios only. Do not expand it into daemon behavior, persistence, team workflows, aliases, or memory unless a separate, explicit requirement adds those areas.

## Verification

Prefer the repository's documented E2E command through [`scripts/run-e2e.mjs`](../../../scripts/run-e2e.mjs). Confirm failures propagate as non-zero exit codes, and inspect cleanup behavior when tests fail—not only when they pass.
