# Docker E2E scenarios and harness

Basics (run twice, `TMT_E2E_FILES`, sharding, isolation) are in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](../../../../DEVELOPMENT.md#docker-e2e).

## Scenario ownership

Name scenarios for the behavior or adapter they verify. Native-process tests inspect
public contracts and independent stored state; Docker adds real tmux and process
ordering. Consolidate only after mapping setup, causal action, assertions and
failure/cleanup observations; the basic badge case belongs to `pane-badge`.

## Harness rules

- `typescript/test/e2e/cli-assertions.ts` owns `expectJsonResult` (success envelope
  only); scenarios keep their exact payload assertions and independent SQL oracles.
  Do not build a permissive shared schema or import product types to manufacture
  expected results.
- Scenario imports use the `typescript/test/e2e/harness.ts` facade; fixture,
  readiness, cleanup and types live under `typescript/test/e2e/harness/`
  ([ownership](../../../../ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-and-evidence-boundaries)).
  Synchronous fixture tmux calls fail after five seconds and kill the client;
  scenario timeouts stay required. Install a fixture's tmux trace once and reuse
  `clear()`.
- Shared cross-suite utilities go in `typescript/test/support/`; helper tests go in
  `typescript/test/tooling/` and must prove rejection as well as positive behavior.
  The import-direction guard checks these boundaries without Docker.
- Codex channel scenarios build both `tmt-cli` and the `codex-channel-fixture` example
  into the E2E image only; explicit `--channel` sessions wait for the private Ready
  record matched to the foreground, and plain controls keep their foreground-only gate.
- A performance probe never gates on latency; see
  [performance probes](performance-probes.md).
