# Colab development

Behavior and wire shapes are owned by
[`extensions/tmt-colab/contracts/colab-v1.md`](../../../extensions/tmt-colab/contracts/colab-v1.md)
and [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md); this skill covers how to build, run,
package and verify. Shared gates are in [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../../DEVELOPMENT.md).
Colab and Remote share the state leaf: see [tmt-remote](../tmt-remote/SKILL.md).

Always use isolated data roots in tests; never point them at the real TMT directory.
Product limits are named in `src/limits.rs`, not in guides.
