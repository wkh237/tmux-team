# Sync, decoder, page source and export

Source: `extensions/tmt-colab/rust/tmt-colab/src` and `typescript/app/src`. Grammar, budgets
and failure codes are in [colab-v1](../../../../extensions/tmt-colab/contracts/colab-v1.md)
and `limits.rs`; do not restate them.

## Stream sync

- `sync::Server` is the opaque transport: append admission and bounded live subscriber
  queues behind an already-upgraded duplex stream. `Connection::poll` is driven externally
  over nonblocking `Read + Write`; the socket worker owns readiness, timers and shutdown,
  so the server creates no listener, runtime or thread.
- The caller implements `Admission` from its verified owner log and device chains (live
  page, role, namespace, revision, expiry, epoch). The server checks exact model
  envelope, header, hash and signature bindings, then calls the create-only `Store`. It
  never decrypts and never calls the decoder. An exact retry returns the same receipt
  without a rebroadcast; awareness is ephemeral.
- Overflow, an unknown or pruned cursor and any abnormal close end in `RESYNC_REQUIRED`:
  clients reconstruct from a fresh verified catchup. Bytes already written cannot be
  recalled, so a stalled write drops the stream instead of flushing ciphertext.
- Catchup pins the retained owner head (`Store::owner_head`), pages membership statements,
  then scoped baseline, wraps and the latest paired checkpoints before the merged
  namespace tails. The final page and the live subscription commit under the server lock
  so appends during paging are not missed. Large objects use the lazy chunk transfer
  (`sync/wire.rs`), one object per page; partial transfers publish nothing.
- Browser side: `admission.ts` admits statements and envelopes, `fold.worker.ts` folds, and
  `writer.ts` persists exact ciphertext before sending and retries those stored bytes,
  never resealing. One lifetime Web Lock owns each device stream; other tabs relay updates.

## Isolated decoder

- `decoder::Decoder` is one caller-owned child runner per page and the only Yjs consumer.
  `decoder/child.rs` is the sole production `yrs` importer (pinned `=0.28.0` in the
  workspace; the architecture test enforces the import rule). The parent never parses Yjs
  bytes. The hidden `__decoder` entry runs before CLI and data-root routing, and the child
  is launched through `tmt-invoke` with an empty environment allowlist.
- The child checks namespace roots, materialized types and projection bounds, and merges
  only the supplied author updates. It also builds and verifies baselines from exact source
  and title. The parent checks input/output binding and hashes.
- Limits are enforced before decoding and before returning output. Linux sets
  `RLIMIT_AS` in the child before reading input (a failed `setrlimit` rejects the job);
  other platforms, macOS included, report `memory limit unavailable`. This is crash and
  resource containment with the user's filesystem authority, not a sandbox.
- A runner is reusable only after `Cleanup::NotStarted` or `Cleanup::Confirmed`; any state
  where a child may survive blocks it. Invalid output, panic or timeout returns no
  application result. `decoder::Config` carries the program and deadline; only tests inject
  a larger deadline (`tests/support`), and no option tunes the production deadline.

## Page source and export

- `page.rs` reads and writes admitted source locally: it prepares through the fold and
  decoder, and the opaque token binds the owner head, page epoch and every namespace
  position, because content appends do not advance the membership log.
- Offline writes hold the serve lifecycle lock and use `Store::write_existing`; when `serve`
  holds the lock, `page/ipc.rs` makes one bounded request to the owned socket and never
  retries or falls back. The write signs with a purpose-separated local device certified by
  the management member; it is not a Remote registration.
- `export.rs` snapshots exact source and title through `fold::Snapshot` and the decoder and
  writes `page.html` and `manifest.json` (format and disclosure: colab-v1). It adds no HTTP
  route, signing capability or core dependency. The browser equivalent is
  `export.ts` plus the trusted-parent `export-panel.tsx`, built from a committed projection
  and verified head; both serializers are pinned by `contracts/vectors/export-v1.json`.

## Browser containment

- The fold runs in a dedicated Worker, with bounds on state and projection; the parent checks every projection and terminates the Worker on failure or
  deadline. No key or transport capability enters it. Treat it as resource containment.
- Parent chrome policy and renderer policy are two constants in `assets.rs` (`POLICY`,
  `RENDERER_POLICY`); change them only with the colab-v1 renderer section and the
  `renderer.spec.ts` browser checks.
