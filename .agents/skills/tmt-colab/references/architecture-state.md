# Layout, state, transitions and admission

Source: `extensions/tmt-colab/rust/tmt-colab/src`. Exact DTOs, codes and limits are in
[colab-v1](../../../../extensions/tmt-colab/contracts/colab-v1.md) and `limits.rs`; do not
restate them.

## Layout

| Path (under `extensions/tmt-colab/`) | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `rust/tmt-colab-model` | Pure codecs, fixed crypto and the Rust side of the vectors. No I/O, core or Remote. |
| `rust/tmt-colab` | The executable: CLI, owner-only socket, SQLite store, keyring, sync server, owner transitions, isolated Yjs decoder. |
| `typescript/colab-client` | WebCrypto primitives mirroring the model, tested against the shared vectors. |
| `typescript/app` | React/Vite app: trusted parent chrome, renderer, Worker fold, writer, Ask modules and the `acceptance/` suite. |
| `contracts/` | colab-v1 and the frozen vectors with their independent Python oracles. |

## Gotchas

- Run Rust gates with your own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2`. Add
  `--no-fail-fast` when judging `cargo test -p tmt-colab`: Cargo stops at the first failing
  test binary and hides the rest. Timing-sensitive decoder tests can fail under load; rerun
  them alone before treating one as a regression.
- Run the architecture test on every Rust push:
  `cargo test --offline --locked -p tmt-cli --test architecture`.
- Regenerate frozen vectors only with their Python oracle in a throwaway virtualenv with
  `cryptography`, never `--write` outside a reviewed regeneration.

## Persistence layout

- The data root comes from one fixed `storage.root` API call through the absolute
  `$TMT_EXECUTABLE` (`core.rs`, the only core access). A missing or invalid root fails
  before any state is created; `spaces` creates nothing.
- State is `<dataRoot>/colab/` (owned 0700, no symlink) holding `owner.key`, `serve.lock`,
  `keyring.lock`, `space.db` and the socket `door.sock` (0600 files). The layout is the
  `tmt-extension-state` leaf behind `keyring::Layout`; Colab adds only its file names and
  error codes. `Keyring` publishes the owner seed create-only; an existing wrong-length key
  fails closed (`COLAB_KEY_INVALID`) and is never replaced. The seed never leaves
  `Keyring`; callers ask it to sign or seal.
- `space.db` schemas are append-only (`store/schema.rs`): 1 ciphertext (pages, streams,
  receipts, checkpoints), 2 owner authority (membership log, recipients, devices, epoch
  secrets, wraps, `owner_operations`), 3 `device_registrations`, 4 `baselines`. Epoch
  secrets are local key material, not an encrypted-at-rest guarantee.
- `Store::open` creates and migrates. `Store::read` and `Store::write_existing` open only
  existing 0600 state owned by the user, create nothing and never migrate;
  `write_existing` requires the serve lifecycle lock and exactly the current schema.
  **Adding a migration means updating the hard-coded current version in
  `Store::existing`** as well as `MIGRATIONS`.
- Receipts are create-only: an exact retry returns the stored receipt, a conflicting
  envelope freezes its stream. Checkpoint publication prunes a shared prefix only when
  every namespace with updates there has a checkpoint at the same sequence/hash; pinned
  checkpoints and receipts survive. Capacity returns `Fault::Capacity`; nothing is evicted.
- The store never decides authority. Callers verify signatures, roles, sessions and epochs
  before an append (`Admission`, below).

## Owner-local transitions

- `fold.rs` verifies the retained owner hash chain and derives page and issuer policy from
  signed statements. A SQLite read snapshot supplies epoch keys, cuts, certificates,
  checkpoints and tails; objects are verified before they are decrypted, and content
  merges go through the isolated decoder. A baseline must match its signed descriptor.
- `transitions::Engine` owns one decoder per page and is the only signer of statements.
  `transitions/request.rs` is the dispatch seam for admitted `OwnerRequest` values;
  `membership.rs`, `links.rs`, `sharing.rs` and `epoch.rs` implement member, link,
  page-policy and epoch changes with the same atomic runner.
- Preparation (decoder work, baselines) happens outside the writer reservation; the commit
  rechecks head, page epoch, namespace cuts and device projections. A moving snapshot is
  retried three times, then returns `STALE_HEAD`.
- Signed statement, secrets, baseline, wraps, page epoch and the operation receipt commit in
  one transaction or not at all; `owner_operations` makes an exact retry return the saved
  outcome with its original head. Callers propagate mutation errors so everything rolls back.
- Link seeds are borrowed for key derivation and never persisted or returned
  (`transitions/links.rs`).

## Admission and lock order

- `socket.rs` treats registration, session, pages, management, the reserved page-write and
  device-events routes and the reader challenge/session routes specially. The root-local
  management and page-write routes deny any request carrying a forwarded
  `tmt-device-context` or device-event header (`local_denied`), and Remote refuses to
  forward the reserved `/.tmt/` subtree from browsers.
- **Lock order: the sync lock before the `Registration` mutex** (`registration.rs`).
  Management serializes with sync first, so an owner change and the shutdown of matching
  live handles are one step.
- `registration::Registration` owns the store/keyring pair. It verifies both
  remote-owned extension-key certificates against the full forwarded owner context before
  signing. Remote owns pairing, cookies and grants.
- Revocation arrives as a revision-ordered device event: known devices use the owner
  transition, unknown IDs a local tombstone. Equal or older events and already-revoked
  devices write nothing and close no tunnel.
- `management.rs` holds strict DTOs and device-signature admission and adapts to the
  engine; it never writes authority tables or chooses baselines, cuts, wraps or epoch
  keys. The CLI (`cli_grammar.rs`, `cli_management.rs`, `inspection.rs`) is root-local:
  `ls`, `show`, `share mode` and `share link`. It uses the private socket IPC when `serve`
  holds the lifecycle lock and the offline path otherwise; an uncertain IPC reply never
  falls back to a second writer (`cli_management.rs`, `page/ipc.rs`).
- `readers::Sessions` keeps at most 64 ephemeral challenges, tickets and active readers
  (`CAP`), with a one-minute challenge and ten-minute session. Readers are page- and
  epoch-scoped and never owner devices or writers (`readers.rs`).
