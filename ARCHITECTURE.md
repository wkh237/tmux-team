# Architecture

The shipped CLI runtime is the Rust workspace in `rust/`. An optional Office
SPA foundation lives in `apps/office`; it is not a CLI fallback or a shipped
connector. The root Node package is private developer tooling. It may host Vitest,
fixture and release-verification helpers, but it is not a second CLI runtime,
an npm product, or a source-install fallback. A native source checkout selects
`rust/target/debug/tmt` (or an explicitly supplied native executable); a missing
native build is an error. No test, script, or installer may silently execute an
installed host `tmt` or a retired TypeScript product implementation. Node may
run explicit developer fixtures and verifiers, never serve as a product fallback.

Published releases are immutable. Source changes do not publish replacements
or migrate application data.
TMT remains an invocation-owned local CLI, without a remote MCP server, identity
memory or a separate inbox service. The independently installed Office companion may
run one explicit loopback-only browser service; it does not execute CLI work or change
the CLI's invocation-owned storage policy.

Any retained `better-sqlite3` use belongs to private developer tooling as an
independent oracle. It is not a Rust runtime dependency or an alternate owner
of native schema and application state.

## Office workspace boundary

The pnpm workspace has one lockfile, the `@tmt/office` SPA and the
`@tmt/office-service` trusted pairing service. Existing
Rust, test, release script and canonical skill paths remain stable. Read
[Office architecture](docs/office/architecture.md) for current SPA ownership,
the chosen React/Vite/TanStack/Jotai stack and the
[Office design](docs/office/design.md) for planned trust/lifecycle semantics.
Office runtime code must not import local SQLite/process adapters or native test helpers.
The accepted [World extension design](contracts/office/functional-props.md)
separates spatial composition from concrete board/notebook/broadcast features.
Bundled features are not automatically World core. Reuse existing domain services;
extract capability interfaces from consumers rather than adding another command
runner or exchange engine. The first [data-only binding](contracts/office/extension-v1.md)
composes discussion and whiteboard resource views with physical instances through
a guarded host registry; native/browser admission is separate from capability
registration. Shared `useExtensionPanel` owns the native modal lifetime, while
each resource retains its own draft and persistence owner. Whiteboard
`useWhiteboardPanel` admits document switches from the editor's aggregate leave
state: unsaved content requires confirmation, while pending document/snapshot/send
operations retain their original owner until resolved. Closing a panel is not a
document switch or disposal.
The local [whiteboard scene contract](contracts/office/whiteboard-v1.md) keeps
drawing values separate from World placement, request delivery and resource storage.
Pure scene policy belongs to `tmt-core::office_whiteboard`, its strict JSON boundary
to `tmt-adapters::office_whiteboard`, and the matching browser projection to
`whiteboard/scene-contract.ts`; literal vectors cover both projections.
Document revision policy lives in its core `document` module, envelope admission
in the adapter, and atomic document/operation persistence in
`storage/office_whiteboard`. The local HTTP adapter and browser document port
reuse the existing session transport; neither owns editor history or request
delivery. World singleton creation is shared by world layout, board ownership
and document persistence through `storage/office_world` inside caller transactions.
Whiteboard `snapshot` policy captures a specific saved revision and validates its
selection/annotation. Its adapter owns metadata admission; the storage child module
appends an immutable scene copy using the capture operation as its replay receipt.
It reuses the document read/transaction/error boundaries, not request or board receipt
tables. The adapter's `image` module admits bounded PNG pixels and normalizes uploads;
`snapshot/image` stores one immutable attachment with pixel-equivalent retries.
Reads revalidate pixels without re-encoding the original stored bytes. Image admission
does not attest scene semantics. The local HTTP module owns exact typed resource
routing shared with body-budget selection; image writes reuse the existing Origin
policy with a PNG content type. The browser snapshot state owns capture/image retry,
reusing the document painter and the local runtime's shared request lifetime;
the view owns only form state and disposable preview URLs. Native snapshot access
uses the same repository through `office_whiteboard::access` in the verified
companion, with exact per-operation JSON/PNG limits. `office_companion::whiteboard`
validates replies over its parent's existing bounded process owner. The CLI owns
the explicit export path, while `office_whiteboard::export` publishes a private,
no-clobber file. The core snapshot module owns local reference identity; browser
formatting/resolution shares conformance vectors.
The local [request dispatch capability](contracts/office/dispatch-v1.md) composes
explicit recipients over `RequestService::enqueue`. Core `dispatch` owns
composition values, its adapter owns JSON/digests, and `storage::dispatch`
owns an immutable acceptance ledger in schema 23. `storage::requests` lends its
existing row adapter through `TransactionRequests` inside the caller's transaction;
there is no nested transaction or parallel request SQL/state. One operation and
all accepted/failed recipient attempts commit together. The HTTP adapter retains
the existing browser authority and settings/connection owners. `LocalRuntime.dispatch`
uses the shared authenticated transport and validates receipt operation/audience.
The shared `local/dispatch-composer-state` owns frozen message/audience intent and
explicit retries. Whiteboard `snapshot-send-state` adds immutable reference/message
formatting; the broadcaster selects announcement semantics. Capture/image state
does not own sends.
Direct `local/agent-conversation` composes that same state with canonical request
history. `use-agent-conversation` owns one retained non-modal Chat/Info HUD;
`conversation-cue` derives waiting/reply attention from canonical history with a
view-local seen marker, never a stored acknowledgment or execution state.
`conversation-state` owns bounded visible-only observation; the optional
scope-checked `dispatch-journal` keeps only unconfirmed intent in tab session
storage, separating direct recipient/context keys from room-roster keys.
`local/room-message` retains one room composer with explicit roster adoption,
review and guarded target switching; it uses the same composer and receipt recovery.
Accepted history and replies remain host-owned; credentials are never
written to the journal. Receipt lookup is read-only and retries preserve the
original operation and audience.
Discussion `local/board-share` supplies a live thread UUID and native reader
instruction to the same composer; it does not create snapshot storage or another
reference parser. The board retains its content/draft owner while the request
view freezes the selected thread and requires explicit discard before leaving.
The [meeting-room resource](contracts/office/meeting-room-v1.md) owns explicit local
rosters in schema 24. Fan-out reads its effective membership inside the existing
enqueue transaction and fences both room revision and UUID audience, after replay
lookup. Retirement filters active projections without changing core identity hooks.
Browser `RoomPicker` uses the shared local port and `IdentityChecklist`; refreshing
a list cannot expand frozen intent. Canonical `RequestKind` distinguishes replyable
requests from inbox-only announcements (schema 25); the request service owns
no-response policy, incoming attention and settlement. Dispatch includes kind in
intent comparison without changing existing request digests. The bundled broadcaster
opens the shared composer through the guarded extension binding; opening never
selects an audience or sends automatically. Physical meeting areas reference these
room UUIDs; `office-population` projects memberships without duplicating identities.
The same `RoomPicker` manages room definitions independently of a layout draft.
Its shared `RoomEditor` owns revision-fenced writes and explicit readback after
uncertain saves. Adopting a readback is an explicit action, never an automatic
overwrite or another room creation. The world-anchored `MeetingCreationForm`
reuses that editor, retaining a confirmed room UUID and proposed area ID across
placement failures. `meeting-module` attaches the room through the existing
world history and furniture recipe; layout Cancel never deletes the room.
`world-map/meeting-preset` adds ordinary placements/resource bindings to that draft;
it does not create rooms, whiteboard content or requests. Browser authoring and
actor preview placement share the sparse `world-map/free-floor` interval owner.
Derived actor slots prefer clear views using `world-geometry`'s existing wall
projection and paint depth, then fall back to safe floor when an area is crowded.
This preference changes neither saved positions nor membership and is cached per geometry.
Core `office_whiteboard::document::empty_document` describes a virtual blank for
any admitted unsaved document ID. Storage reads do not materialize it; explicit
conditional Save remains the only content creation path. The Lobby has no special
storage branch, and snapshot capture still requires a persisted document.
CLI `room send` and `room broadcast` use that same atomic composition owner,
returning immutable per-recipient inbox acceptance without waiting for replies.
The trusted CLI adapter resolves optional sender provenance through the existing
identity context; HTTP admission still rejects caller-selected senders. Known
sender provenance participates in intent hashing and canonical request attention.
Unknown-sender HTTP digests and the historical ledger table name remain unchanged.
An explicit operation UUID permits identical-intent retry; a changed room roster
is a conflict, never permission to enqueue a new audience under the old UUID.
Core `operation` owns UUID generation for both board mutation and dispatch retry
identities. Direct `talk --room` selects only its named recipient; it never fans
out. The shared request service verifies effective membership within preparation's
transaction through `RequestRecords`, backed by the existing room reader. This
applies to inbox enqueue and pane preparation, before cadence or attention writes;
CLI preflight alone is not treated as an atomic membership fence.
Core `room::RoomRepository` is the shared CLI/HTTP roster boundary. Its resolver
accepts canonical UUIDs or unique exact labels and rejects ambiguous names.
Adapter `room` owns the wire projection used by both transports; storage table
names remain unchanged. CLI `room` creation/list/show/join/leave requires no Office
installation; explicit identity selection does not probe tmux. `ls --room` filters
the existing presence projection rather than introducing another presence owner.
Office preserves that projection's `active`, `offline`, and `unknown` states
through HTTP and UI; self-reported status and roster membership do not override it.
Atomic membership set changes reuse the same `storage::room` writer and
immediate transaction as conditional roster replacement; callers do not perform
an unlocked read-modify-write. Room retirement is a revision-checked transition
in that same row; the repository separates active selection from historical UUID
lookup. Dispatch and new spatial bindings use active selection, while committed
receipts, delivered requests and retained areas remain intact. CLI and HTTP reuse
the transition; no archive database or cascading content deletion is introduced.
Scoped delivery and spatial integration are defined
in [rooms and walls](contracts/office/rooms-and-walls.md), not implemented by roster
commands alone.
The local [map v1 foundation](contracts/office/map-v1.md) separates topology from
resource contents. `tmt-core::office_map` owns native admission and derived walls.
Its `modules` owner projects fixed room slots and circulation into that same
admission boundary. [Versioned modular topology](contracts/office/modules-v2.md) stores
the module source only; the admitted map's immutable floor/edge projection is
not another write model. The map codec preserves v1 values until explicit
conversion; v2 retains short links and v3 derives continuous grid
corridors. V4 adds a 2×2 Lobby and a bounded public lattice independent of paired
rooms. Its row-run generator excludes private interiors and the reserved meeting
wing; centered entrances are derived from adjacent public floor. Old geometry
remains readable. `world-map/module-upgrade` converts v2/v3 into V4 as a single
draft: offices south of the Lobby move one row with their interior contents,
the Lobby's south mounts follow its enlarged boundary, and meetings stay fixed.
Area IDs, assignments, materials and resource attachments remain unchanged.
Ambiguous corridor/exterior objects block conversion without mutation.
V6 adds an explicit platform preview through the same relocation boundary:
immediate Lobby neighbors use entrance-only links, remote offices retain public
access, and separated meeting pods branch from an independent spine. Both native
and browser module projection own the topology; rendering does not invent paths.
Stored v4/v5 geometry remains unchanged until explicit conversion.
The platform draft converts mounted objects into floor decorations while keeping
their IDs, artwork and resource bindings. Ownerless or oversized objects reject
the draft without mutating the source. Undo and Cancel retain the original value.
`world-map/freeform-upgrade` proposes v1 modules through the same eligible-slot
policy: one primary Lobby, personal areas near their previous relative positions,
and a separate ordered meeting wing. It preserves area IDs and bindings. Shared
object relocation checks complete source support, including holes, and rejects
contents that cannot fit the destination. Empty areas and extra Lobbies require
explicit resolution; no rooms, objects or attachments are silently discarded.
Upgrading is never a bare version toggle or an
implicit repacking operation. It is an explicit draft change validated by the normal Save,
not a read-time migration. Browser
`world-map/map-source` decodes that union and caches the read-only projection used
by rendering, population and discovery. Existing world history and revisioned
Save retain source modules; modular drafts cannot call the legacy floor writer.
`world-map/module-authoring` offers unoccupied cardinal office slots using those
same bounds/reserved-wing rules. Choosing a hologram only selects a slot; naming
and adding commits a module through the existing world history, not persistence.
`rendering/scene-module-ghost` is disposable presentation of that slot, while
`office-expansion-form` supplies anchored text entry and keyboard slot selection.
The renderer projects the complete hologram bounds through `selection-anchor`;
the shared anchored-panel hook measures the form and actual toolbar/save-bar
clearance, placing it beside that target within the HUD-safe viewport. Office
and meeting creation hide the general layout inspector while retaining its state.
The shared projector still supplies existing point anchors
for actor and furniture controls. Panel measurement is disposable presentation,
not another camera or layout state. Its resize observer is released on unmount.
Module removal uses the same source/history owner. Its preview checks all retained
placements against candidate spatial support, including disappearing common floor
and partitions; blocked placements must be moved or explicitly removed first.
It never mutates canonical identities, membership or linked resources. Native Save
still owns full connectivity and content admission. V4 meeting expansion uses
the same wing descriptors for the saved topology and cyan construction preview;
room membership remains with the targeted room manager. The agent Info panel's
Add to meeting entry seeds that manager's existing `RoomEditor` draft with one
candidate; it does not write or dispatch. Conditional roster Save retains other
members, and an unsaved draft fences both room and candidate switching.
The native `office_world::starter` supplies a furnished v6 platform Lobby and four
unassigned offices only when neither a saved world layout nor retained blocks
exist. Stable placement IDs and bundled resource bindings remain read-only until
explicit Save; the existing revision-zero source fingerprint fences that Save.
Saved layouts never reseed. Explicit conversion is separate from this initializer;
legacy layouts retain object editing and explicit area removal for conversion
repair, but no floor painting, zoning or manual door authoring. The new-world
preset is not a migration of existing content. New objects use floor support;
the initializer does not create wall-mounted lights, windows or decorations.
`world-map/module-geometry` derives the shared connection descriptors used by
floor projection and portal presentation. Two physical thresholds remain in the
admitted map; v2 rendering paints one frame per short passage. V3 corridors
separate the physical thresholds and expose their shared floor.
`tmt-adapters::office_map` owns its strict codec. Browser `world-map` owns bounded
draft editing and disposable rendering projection, not save authority. Literal
vectors cover shared geometry and intentional draft/admission differences.
Browser `rendering/world-projection` separates saved ground coordinates from
cutaway scene coordinates. Floors contract in depth, upright artwork keeps
its proportions, and object picking/dragging uses the same forward/inverse
transform. V3 retains expanded inter-row display gaps. V4 reserves rear-wall
space inside each derived module instead: public circulation stays unexpanded,
and the admitted floor index identifies the owner for room-floor and wall/mount
projection. Geometry owns this map-specific transform instance, including ghost
placement, Fit and HUD anchors. Upright artwork is never stretched with the floor.
It owns no persisted layout or placement state.
V6 removes the wall reserve: rooms and bridges share one projected floor plane.
Closed boundaries paint thin platform trim and downward front-edge thickness;
open boundaries have no door art. Flat construction ghosts use the same projection.
The following cutaway wall rendering rules apply to retained pre-v6 layouts.
`world-map/floor-index` provides sparse row ownership queries for both boundary
projection and extension discovery; it does not allocate a second per-tile map or
persist object-area membership. Wall discovery and placement suggestions use the
same mounted-face interior tile convention.
`rendering/world-geometry` derives cutaway bounds and wall/mount paint depth from
those boundaries. Front corner posts derive from owned side-wall endpoints;
door splits never create duplicate posts. `world-projection` owns one room-wall
rise and a distinct circulation-rail rise shared by drawing and previews.
Room portals retain the same rise as their walls.
The existing editor lifetime controls wall translucency in `scene-wall`; entering
or leaving editing redraws presentation without changing geometry or hit testing.
The bundled architecture atlas supplies reviewed frame views
through `scene-materials`; front and rear share one straight-wall frame and
nine-slice crown/base definition, with cutaway height owned by geometry.
It cannot introduce independent topology or placement
state. Texture views share one mount-owned source and are disposed before it.
`editor/snapshot-history` supplies bounded undo/redo to map and whiteboard drafts;
domain decoders retain value ownership. The production UI uses a whole-world
draft and the same revisioned native persistence, not per-identity block editors.
The [world value foundation](contracts/office/world-v1.md) composes that map with
stable placement IDs. `tmt-core::office_world` validates floor/wall support,
door clearance and window exclusions over the map index. Shared prop appearance
admission is independent of the legacy 32x32 bounds; signed positions support
world coordinates without loosening legacy block validity. The world adapter
composes the existing typed map and prop codecs. `storage/office_world` persists
the all-or-error candidate in the existing world row (schema 28), checking revision,
identity/room eligibility and artwork within one immediate transaction. Before
explicit cutover, retained blocks have a read-only deterministic projection fenced
by a source fingerprint. First Save retires those rows atomically; schema triggers
prevent renewed block writes. `office layout show/apply` and the world HTTP route
share `office_world::access` for storage execution and public diagnostics; strict
companion decoding and bounded file acquisition remain adapter responsibilities.
The CLI has no local block alias. Old local block HTTP/private companion operations
and browser port are removed; legacy native/browser scenario fixtures still need
conversion, not a compatibility wrapper or competing layout writer. The world contract owns
the migration and uncertain-save behavior; resources keep their existing owners.
`office_extension::ResourceBinding` owns pure resource-reference validity; the
adapter reuses its codec for preflight and world attachments. Former bundled
functional entries become ordinary placements, never content copies.
External links extend that binding with an inert URL, not a new placement action
store. Core admission uses the workspace-pinned `url` parser for pure syntax and
credential checks; the reviewed core dependency policy permits parsing, not HTTP
clients. Browser admission shares literal vectors and uses its platform parser.
The guarded `link.open` handler opens a destination review, never a URL itself;
only the review's explicit no-opener anchor navigates. Neither storage nor rendering
fetches links, and artwork remains independent of the action.
`local_service/world` and the browser world port use the existing authenticated,
bounded transport. Browser `world-draft` supplies one complete-candidate history
to the production editor and renderer. Surface controls change the same placement,
not a second wall layout; resource bindings survive moves and unmounting.
The wall collection is an ordinary immutable indexed prop pack. Native and browser
catalogs admit the same bytes; windows, lights and decorations share art resolution
and missing-art fallback. A wall light adds a static renderer-owned glow, not a
shader/runtime capability. Browser placement suggestions inspect derived boundaries
and occupied silhouettes, but never authorize Save or move other objects. Numeric
coordinates and appearance text stay in local input forms until one complete edit
enters world history. Shared prop customization controls serve both editor callers.
Schema 26 retains an optional original room UUID on canonical request attempts.
Shared dispatch distinguishes single-recipient room context from reviewed full-roster
fan-out. Only fan-out checks the roster revision; canonical `RequestService` checks
recipient membership for both inside the enqueue transaction. The tagged mode is
part of immutable retry intent, not another delivery path. Dispatch copies its
room UUID into `PrepareRequest`; it does
not make the dispatch ledger a second context store. Shared row projection and
attention models carry that value through detail and incoming results. Room-scoped
listen filters the watermark and both incoming queries in the same request owner,
using participant/room indexes before pagination. The CLI resolves the room once;
subsequent roster changes do not hide already-delivered work. Unscoped requests
and JSON retain their existing behavior. Room lifecycle cannot cascade into
request retention, and transport adapters do not infer historical membership.
Schema 27 adds indexed keyset history over those same attempts, not chat storage.
`request::history` owns the owner-visible projection, and its service composes
retention and the existing attention final-state interpretation. Storage reuses
the canonical attempt/response row decoders; bounded UTF-8 previews preserve
embedded NUL without loading full message bodies into lists. The `request_history`
adapter admits/encodes the owner API without reply proofs or pane paths. HTTP
inspection requires the same bearer/Origin admission as dispatch. Operation lookup
and dispatch replay share the existing immutable ledger decoder; lookup cannot
resubmit. Browser `LocalRuntime.requests` owns only bounded typed transport and
response-scope checks, not another request cache or completion policy.
The [workshop references](docs/office/references/workshop/README.md)
own visual intent, not evidence that proposed extension APIs are implemented.
Its browser E2E may reuse the established test-only process and artifact owners.
The pairing issuer is implemented for local emulator verification and disabled
by default outside that environment; it is not deployed. `contracts/office`
owns the versioned work-handoff schema and fixtures; derived representations must
prove conformance there. Structural tests do not prove remote authorization or
delivery. Future connector dispatch reuses native request/storage ownership,
not CLI-output scraping or a competing exchange engine. Ordinary CLI operations
remain independent of Office.

Office has app-owned boundaries: `auth` initializes Firebase/session,
`worlds` owns admission and world access, and `blocks` owns the layout contract,
codec, adapter and editor lifecycle. `pairing` owns public-link decoding, explicit
owner approval/revocation and sanitized action state, reusing the selected-world
lifecycle and authenticated runtime composition. `spaces` projects bounded
owner-only grant pages and selects the existing block editor; it has no
assignment registry or permission mutation. Rules and the trusted issuer
enforce authority; views never grant it. Remote snapshots have one owner, separate
from unsaved drafts and ephemeral
presentation state. No stored markup executes and no parallel layout is stored.
Native decoration uses `tmt-core::office_block` for pure layout validation and
codec conformance, `tmt-adapters::office_block` for readable JSON, and the existing
paired companion for authenticated conditional Firestore commits. Browser and
native implementations share the versioned block contract and literal vectors;
neither creates a second scene store. The CLI owns grammar and presentation, not
credentials, grant renewal or Firestore transactions.
The offline local Office path is separate from the Firebase runtime. Both one-shot CLI
layout commands and the loopback HTTP service call the same whole-world access boundary in
`tmt-adapters`; neither mirrors state into the SPA. `tmt-office` embeds the Vite local
build at compile time, so the fixed native archive inventory does not gain mutable web
files. A private receipt coordinates one installation-wide process. Browser and control
tokens are distinct, status is token-free, and only exact IPv4 loopback Host/Origin
requests reach the bounded HTTP adapter. Manual area bindings use identity UUIDs;
retirement does not erase stored placements or linked content.
The local overview and identity deep links select the same whole-world loader,
editor and mount-owned Pixi renderer. React owns browse panels independently of
selection and the world draft. Directory/area browsing and layout editing suspend
the retained agent HUD. Chat/Info share one recipient/context; minimized chat
observes replies, while closing pauses observation without cancelling work.
The existing scene camera projects the selected actor anchor; an absent/offscreen
actor uses a viewport fallback. Hidden details retain unsaved appearance edits;
changing panels never resizes the canvas. The editing HUD uses one viewport overlay
grid for the header, tools, inspector and variable-height save feedback. Camera controls remain
owned by the mounted canvas and portal into one stable top-line dock in both browse
and edit modes. The header and camera wrap together without fixed-height offsets;
neither docking nor error feedback rebuilds the scene or reserves physical canvas space.
Same-runtime refresh retains the mounted workspace and its drafts, reports read
failure in place, and fences late reads from replaced runtimes. The world editor adopts refreshed saved snapshots only
outside editing and never rolls back a locally confirmed revision. The world
port distinguishes a confirmed revision rejection from an
unconfirmed write. Area-removal previews consume the same population projection
and physical object-anchor lookup as browsing, not separate ownership state.
Physical viewport changes preserve the viewed world center and relative zoom.
Remote block
views retain their separate SVG/editor path. Neither renderer owns persistence.
Sparse world geometry supplies floor/wall object bounds for artwork, selection,
culling and interaction; object dragging inverts that projection before editing
stored coordinates. The component overlay consumes those bounds and inert action
metadata, not a competing placement format. It owns measured action-label bounds
and matching paint/hit order. Rendering is invalidation-driven with bounded pixel
density and cancellation/teardown of browser and GPU resources.
Long wall faces retain their original bounds and material phase; repeated seam
and crown detail is generated only across the rendered viewport. Camera movement
must not create artificial wall ends or tessellate offscreen detail along an
otherwise visible wall run.
Fixed architectural materials share one decoded source per mount with bounded,
lazy finish variants owned by `scene-materials`; they do not enter the editable
prop catalog or occupy saved floor tiles. Module source selects the finish through
the existing world draft, without changing geometry or resource bindings.
The in-progress directional prop format extends the existing catalog and raster
projection, not the scene state owner; see the versioned
[prop contract](contracts/office/prop-pack-v2.md). Prop-specific byte budgets and
schema 18 do not change avatar admission or unrelated command envelopes.
Reviewed modular source art is encoded offline into the same immutable v2 prop
packs; both native and browser registries admit those exact contract bytes.
The optional `scripts/art` authoring tool is not a runtime decoder or validator.
Its source-hashed crop manifest and derivative policy live with the visual package.
`world-object-placement` owns bundled wall-authoring hints used by both library
grouping and initial kind/mount selection. These hints grant no capability or
placement authority; arbitrary admitted artwork still uses the same world validation.
Legacy local blocks are retained migration input, not live HTTP write targets.
The whole-world draft owns per-placement tint/text and its CAS commit; pack
capabilities remain the source of allowed fields. Browser artwork authoring uses
the existing native prop validator and catalog install transaction through the
local props adapter. Exact source bytes determine immutable identity; artwork
Save never writes a world placement. The typed browser port verifies digest and
revision receipts and resolves saved packs on demand. `pixel-canvas` commits one
completed pointer stroke or keyboard edit into shared bounded snapshot history;
`use-pixel-catalog` owns catalog observations and frozen save/retry intent.
`pixel-workshop` composes drawing, existing indexed previews and on-demand library
selection. Both library art and built-in furniture enter the same world-draft
placement action; catalog Save and layout Save remain separate transactions.
Shared prop resolution and frame projection feed both renderers, with value-aware
texture keys. Authoring warnings inspect admitted packs without replacing strict
admission or granting executable capabilities.
Owner approval may select a revoked grant's retained block through the same
bounded space projection. The pairing transaction reserves that source grant
with a transfer receipt and records immutable approval intent; no second
assignment registry or resource copy is introduced.
The detailed lifecycle and verification map lives only in
[Office architecture](docs/office/architecture.md); exact persisted data belongs
in [Office contracts](contracts/office/README.md).

`services/office` owns isolated emulator infrastructure, Rules and the trusted
pairing issuer under `functions/`, not a deployed backend. Admin operations
bypass Rules: the issuer explicitly checks verified human authentication, live
admission, ownership and grant authority in its transaction owner. Signing stays
outside transactions. Rules enforce the issued grant using the existing UUID
block validator. The native companion consumes this issuer through its optional
Office adapter feature. See
[pairing v1](contracts/office/pairing-v1.md) for approval/retry semantics and the
agent-grant contract for resource leases. Owner-local configuration stays outside Git and Docker. Native tmux,
Office browser/Rules and bootstrap smoke proofs retain separate fixture owners.
Installation-local data-only prop and avatar packs are implemented under separate bounded
contracts below. They share only reviewed indexed-art, framed-digest, cursor and preview
mechanics; each retains typed validation, storage tables, revision/cursor domain and quotas.
Profiles may select admitted avatar art through immutable digest/key references; catalog
removal leaves the reference intact and falls back to the stored default appearance.
Avatar built-ins use the same validated native registry for list/show, profile
admission and the authenticated browser catalog. They do not seed database rows
or consume retained-pack quotas; custom catalog revisions remain storage-owned.
Community exchange and exploration remain a [sandbox plan](docs/office/sandbox.md), not a
runtime SDK, identity registry or alternate exchange engine.

`scripts/ci-scope.mjs` owns conservative affected-area selection and final gate
validation. Office-only source/docs avoid native matrices; native source/skill
changes avoid Office. Shared or unknown paths (including lockfiles, security,
contracts, workflows and test tooling) fan out. Empty diffs fail closed to both.
Diffs include deletions and both sides of renames. Existing required check names
remain; `Code quality` gates selected Office verification and `Native package
matrix` gates all selected native jobs. Selected skipped, cancelled or failed
jobs cannot satisfy either gate. No passing zero-test configuration is allowed.

## Runtime layers

The Rust crates have deliberately narrow responsibilities:

| Layer             | Owner                           | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

`rust/crates/tmt-cli/tests/architecture.rs` is a test-only import and
dependency guard. It follows the actual Rust module tree, checks reviewed
layer edges and shared declaration ownership, and fails closed for unsupported
module remapping or incomplete discovery. It is a syntactic guard and never
replaces review of behavior or effects.

The optional `rust/crates/tmt-office` executable is independently versioned and
exposes the compatibility probe and typed one-shot pairing/status/inspect/sync operations.
It depends on core and the existing adapters, not the CLI. Its adapter `office`
feature owns validated deployment decoding, bounded HTTP, protected pairing
records and explicit platform credential stores; ordinary CLI builds do not enable
that feature. Serde derives reject duplicate/unknown descriptor fields; the URL
Standard library matches browser URL interpretation instead of introducing a
handwritten parser. Neither dependency enters core. The probe acquires no
credentials or network data. `tmt-core::office_protocol` owns the fixed typed
handshake; `tmt-adapters::office_companion` verifies active installation ownership
and starts the existing bounded subprocess under the installer lock, then waits
outside that lock and validates the version selected at launch.
Its contract is [native companion handshake](contracts/office/native-companion.md).
Local presentation profiles are a separate UUID-owned resource: `tmt-core::office_profile`
owns the literal default catalog, text bounds, optional immutable `avatarRef` grammar and
deterministic default; SQLite schema 15 owns only the canonical override and CAS revision.
Native commands and authenticated loopback HTTP reuse that owner. A profile change to a
different custom reference and its catalog admission are checked in one immediate SQLite
transaction. A retained reference remains editable when its pack is removed or corrupt,
and exact reinstall restores its art without rewriting the profile. Layout, role, notes,
identity and presence are never profile fields. Browser SVG and canvas share the default
`profiles/avatar-art` projection and `profiles/avatar-layout` display metrics; admitted
custom art keeps its immutable raster. The bundled v2 default uses named material
slots and the same palette-tint operation as furniture; these authoring slots do
not add a catalog or installed-pack schema. Avatar v1/v2 preserve their own versioned
digest domains and one-/two-digit encodings within the same file, cell and catalog
budgets. Native `office_avatar::avatar_format` owns versioned admission and summary
dimensions; browser `avatars/avatar-contract::avatarRaster` preserves encoding for
catalog resolution and previews. `rendering/indexed-raster` draws
inert pixels for both avatars and admitted props; avatar artwork never enters the prop
catalog. Identity and shirt text remain separate accessible text overlays, never executable
artwork.
The public `office` subtree composes installation, identity resolution and bounded
pairing observation, never credentials or HTTP. `office_pairing` separates wire
values, remote Auth/resource access, vault access, local installation metadata,
record transitions and one-shot composition. Resource access refreshes Auth and
performs bounded lease renewal separately; only an exact authenticated issuer
readback can replace the local expiry. No timer or background process renews
grants, and local status stays network-free. `office_http` shares bounded JSON
transport with deployment discovery. Existing ConfigPaths, identity storage,
file locks and process owners remain authoritative. One protected scope record
owns pending proof or credentials; SQLite hooks contain only its opaque scope
reference, never a duplicate credential or grant. OS random
bytes create proofs; explicit Keychain/Secret Service backends fail closed.
Background connection and resource editing remain unimplemented.

Explicit `office unpair` reuses the record's reduction-only revocation path and
scope lock. Only a confirmed revoked receipt can be replaced by a new explicit
pair request. Owner cancellation of an unknown public request uses the existing
issuer transaction to write a disabled pairing, never a second cancellation store.
Browser request snapshots share the existing contract decoder across state and
transport; uncertain cancellation prevents switching back to approval.

Identity retirement remains the existing binding transaction's responsibility.
`tmt-core::identity_hooks` owns typed subscriptions and delivery state;
`storage::identity_hooks` registers subscriptions and atomically queues retirement
notifications from that same transaction. It has no Office dependency. Consumers
run after commit: `office_pairing::hooks` uses the existing protected-record and
per-scope lock owners to revoke, retain a secret-free receipt, then acknowledge.
No SQL transaction spans remote work. Office pair/inspect and explicit `office
sync` consume bounded batches; ordinary identity commands only enqueue locally.
No background or punctual remote cleanup is implied. The
[native pairing lifecycle contract](contracts/office/native-pairing.md#identity-retirement-hooks)
owns delivery order, retries and compatibility limitations. This is a retirement
hook, not an arbitrary executable event bus.

Workspace quality checks cover the unified feature graph. Native process
fixtures build products separately to retain ordinary CLI feature isolation;
[Development](DEVELOPMENT.md#rust-checks) owns their symbol/profile selection.

## Public command boundary

`rust/crates/tmt-cli/src/grammar.rs` is the single syntax/help/completion
definition. `parser.rs` turns it into `invocation.rs` values; handlers receive
typed requests and publish through `output.rs`. Hidden commands are still
parsed for controlled internal workflows but are omitted from public help and
completion.

Help retains its selected public command path. The grammar-aware presentation scan
shares option-value boundaries with error-mode recovery, so `-h`/`--help` can bypass
required operands without interpreting payload data as flags. Public help and
completion use command-owned options, not inherited placement-only options. The
public projection preserves command-owned supplemental help instead of adding
per-command presentation branches. Help
never enters runtime dispatch or skill-drift inspection; JSON help remains unsupported.

The maintained public surface is:

- `init`, `config`, `completion`, `learn` and `install` for local setup and
  guidance;
- identity and binding commands: `identity` create/show/list and metadata
  set/get/list/remove with exact filters, `list`/`ls`, `add`, `name`/`this`,
  `whoami`, `unbind`, `rm`/`remove`;
- saved-identity notes through `notes path`;
- profile and exchange commands: `role`, `preamble`, `x list|show|ack|ackall`,
  `reply`, `result`, `talk`/`send`, `check`/`read`;
- managed native updates through `upgrade`/`update`, with the hidden
  `__native-install` and `__native-refresh-skills` composition points used by
  verified release tooling;
- optional `office`, `office install|upgrade|status|uninstall`, local layout and
  local discussion-board operations. Installation
  requires consent; noninteractive root/status never download or prompt.

The grammar owns option placement and rejection. Handlers do not search raw
argv, create competing option parsers, or reinterpret payload text as flags.
JSON and human output use the same typed result and status contracts.
`OutputMode` contains only the supported JSON selection. Unsupported
`--verbose`/`-v` and `--debug` flags are absent from the grammar and fail with
`USAGE_ERROR` before effects; literal message/option-value text is unchanged.

`output::table` is the single plain human-table renderer for binding, identity,
exchange and configuration reports. Callers own columns and typed projections;
the renderer owns control-character escaping, Unicode display-width measurement
and spacing. The CLI-only `unicode-width` dependency does not enter domain or
adapter policy. Tables preserve complete values without terminal probing,
truncation or color; narrow terminals may wrap. JSON and exact prompt, final,
profile and diagnostic bodies bypass table rendering.

## Domain and state ownership

### Identity, names and bindings

`tmt-core::names` owns canonical identity and pane-target classification,
including the pinned normalization/casing behavior and bounded name rules.
Canonicalization is ECMAScript whitespace trim, NFKC and root-locale default
lowercase using pinned ICU data, not case folding or compiler-dependent casing.
Dependency upgrades must not renormalize stored keys.
`tmt-core::identity` owns lifetime and storage-only create/promote policy.
`tmt-core::identity_metadata` owns validated string keys and values, exact-match
filters, typed results and shared metadata operations. Metadata is descriptive,
untrusted data; it does not grant permissions, capabilities, availability or
prompt authority.
`tmt-core::identity_status` owns typed self-reported activity/mood, byte limits,
expiry and set/show/clear semantics. `storage::identity_status` stores one atomic
record per active UUID in schema 29; it neither promotes identities nor mutates
their timestamps, appearance or requests. Expired data stays inspectable but is
not current activity. `identity_command::status` reuses verified caller resolution;
`tmt-adapters::identity_status` owns the shared JSON projection. The
[status contract](contracts/identity-status-v1.md) distinguishes this state from
presence and completion. The Office directory reads active UUID statuses in one
batch and composes that projection beside, never inside, appearance snapshots.
`identities/use-status-clock` schedules the next expiry for the mounted directory;
scene cues and Info consume the same observation. Appearance revision merging
preserves independent status observations. No actor polling or status writes occur
in the renderer.
`tmt-core::binding` owns evidence evaluation, retirement authorization and
binding use cases. Unknown or conflicting endpoint evidence is never treated as
proof of death. Saved identities detach and remain offline; temporary identities
may retire only after conclusive evidence.

The concrete implementations are `storage::{identities,identity_metadata,identity_status,bindings}`
and `tmux::{metadata,evidence,binding,caller,transport}`.
`binding_command` performs caller/target preflight and composes those owners.
Presence is observation, not routing permission; an explicit socket or pane
marker cannot authorize a different identity.
Binding SQLite reads and writes reuse `endpoint::valid_process_id` with checked
signed/unsigned conversion. Invalid stored PIDs fail decoding
without repair or retirement, and invalid inputs fail before insertion.

Names are global within the selected local database, not folder-scoped. Plain
`name`/`add` creates temporary bindings; `-s` saves/promotes the same identity UUID.
Conclusive pane/server death or explicit unbind retires temporary names without
erasing retained exchanges; saved identities remain available offline. Saved
removal requires explicit force. Neither removal nor unbind kills a pane.
`list` may show verified foreign-server identities, but `talk`/`check` routing
remains current-server-only. Pane number, presentation title and socket pathname
alone are not endpoint identity. Publication and recovery preserve the full
server/pane process evidence; ambiguous observations fail closed.

### Saved identity notes

`tmt-core::identity::NotesIdentityId` is the capability boundary for notebook
storage: construction requires a saved identity and a canonical RFC 4122 UUIDv4.
Display names never become path components. `notes_command` resolves the active
identity before requesting filesystem work; omission uses only a verified tmux
caller and explicit selection can use an offline saved identity.

`ConfigPaths` is the sole layout owner. `tmt-adapters::notes` exclusively creates
`<global_dir>/notes/<identity-uuid>/notes.md`, returning an absolute path. It
creates one directory component at a time with owner-only modes, uses exclusive
no-follow file creation, rejects linked/non-directory subtree components and
nonregular targets, and never opens an existing notebook for writing. The file
body, edit concurrency, and retention are ordinary user-filesystem concerns;
there is no SQLite body copy, revision protocol, watcher, lock, file-size policy,
per-agent isolation, or secure deletion claim.

The local Office notebook extension reads that same file through `notes::read`,
which revalidates active saved identity eligibility. It pins directory handles,
refuses symlinks/nonregular files and delegates to `bounded_file::read_opened`;
it never initializes missing notes. The authenticated loopback GET adapter exposes
only UUID/name/exact UTF-8 content, not caller-selected paths or writes. Its separate
1 MiB viewer ceiling does not restrict agent file edits. The browser port and
read-only panel own response admission and cancellable read lifetime, not storage.
See the [notebook contract](contracts/office/notebook-v1.md).

Identity retirement deliberately leaves notebooks in place. A later same-name
identity has a different UUID and therefore a different path. No command moves
notebooks for pane, tmux presentation, role, working-directory, or Office
changes, and no garbage collector is implied.

### Settings and configuration

`tmt-adapters::config::ConfigPaths` is the sole application path owner.
`config::document` preserves unknown JSON fields and validates known settings
through `tmt-core::settings`. `init` exclusively creates the selected local
file as `{}\n`; it neither loads configuration nor opens SQLite or tmux.
Existing files, directories and links are refused without mutation.
Configuration errors retain their stable public codes and useful paths only at
the adapter boundary.

`json_document` owns editable config/tmux metadata number compatibility:
IEEE-754 values with non-finite opaque values serialized as null. Known invalid
settings still fail. Raw object order is retained on targeted edits; this is not
an exact reply/body transformation or the receipt decoder's policy.

### SQLite and durable exchanges

`tmt-adapters::storage` owns one private synchronous `rusqlite` connection,
schema migrations 1 through 14, WAL/foreign-key/FTS5 setup, busy and transaction
boundaries, and close/checkpoint cleanup. Historical schemas and frozen fixture
provenance are evidence, not a second implementation. The adapter keeps raw
connections private and exposes narrow ports to core services.
Migrations preserve recorded names and historical retention backfills. Schema 9
promotes existing identities to saved without changing UUIDs; unsupported custom
identity-table definitions are rejected rather than silently rebuilt. Old
schema-8 writers cannot share the migrated database. Frozen inputs retain their
own provenance in `test/fixtures/storage-history`, not in this architecture map.
Schema 10 adds identity hook subscriptions and terminal delivery receipts;
registration after retirement queues immediately, and delivered subscriptions
cannot be resurrected by registration retries.
Schema 12 adds a typed inbox route and recipient-scoped attention without
fabricating tmux endpoint evidence. One request/final lifecycle remains the
source of truth; originator and recipient acknowledgment are independent.
Schema 13 adds UUID-owned identity metadata with one unique value per key and an
exact `(key, value, identity_id)` search index. Adapter operations revalidate the
active UUID, serialize writes with the existing immediate transaction owner and
enforce the 64-entry limit atomically. Retirement hides metadata; explicit
content removal deletes it, while a same-name replacement receives a new UUID
and inherits nothing.
Schema 14 adds the installation-owned local Office discussion board. Pure bounded
values, actors, receipts and cursor policy live in `tmt-core::office_board`;
`storage::office_board` owns active-UUID and owner-world revalidation, immediate
transactions, soft deletion, board-local idempotency receipts, the single board
revision and indexed keyset pages. The CLI crosses the verified `tmt-office`
one-shot protocol, while the stopped-service-independent companion and authenticated
loopback HTTP adapter call the same repository. Repository categories are
credential-free Git remote identifiers, not permissions, and category discovery
is a synthetic-general plus stored-root projection rather than a registry.
Schema 30 generalizes the stored category identifier and adds canonical room UUID
categories to this same board store. It transactionally preserves existing roots,
replies, tombstones, sequence/revision values and operation receipts. New room
threads require an existing room, not room membership; retained threads and exact
operation replays remain readable after room removal. Room scope is classification,
not access control. Category discovery uses the same indexed keyset ordering for
repository and room identifiers; pre-upgrade category cursors require a fresh page.
CLI `--room` selection reuses the canonical room resolver. The browser discussion
binding selects General or an explicit room UUID in that same store; placement
changes cannot retarget it. `local/board-navigation` aggregates form-owned leave
protection for category, thread and spatial-entry switches. `use-board-mutation`
owns a frozen operation per form; refresh and ordering preserve selection and
unconfirmed writes. Confirmed discard resets forms, not stored content. Closing
the panel retains its mounted session, while explicit retry reuses the original
scope, entry revision and operation UUID.

`tmt-core::request::RequestService` owns preparation, delivery-state
transitions, exact final submission, waiter release, attention revisions and
bounded retention housekeeping. It samples clocks at the transaction boundary,
never holds a transaction across transport, and treats uncertain delivery as
uncertain rather than as a replay authorization. `storage::requests` owns SQL,
row decoding and ordered bounded cleanup; `request::attention` owns the pure
attention contract. Prompt/final content, attempt metadata, retention and
acknowledgment state have independent lifecycle rules.

The request service reserves cadence together with a durable attempt before
sending, then records definitely-failed, sent or uncertain delivery. Only a
definite failure permits the defined reservation refund; timeouts are not proof
of non-delivery. Final bodies are immutable: identical retries are idempotent,
conflicting second finals fail, and terminal text is never used as completion
evidence. `talk` waits for a stored final unless detached or timed out;
`result` reads by request, while identity-owned `x` exposes outstanding attention.
Reads do not acknowledge. `ackall` acknowledges one snapshot, so a later final
becomes unread again. Acknowledgment means handled, not successful or cancelled.
Retention is frozen per attempt; bounded lazy housekeeping must respect active
waiters, preserve the defined acceptance deadline and never resurrect an expired
submission. The settings owner defines retention defaults and limits.

`RequestRoute` distinguishes verified pane delivery from durable identity inbox
queueing. Pane attempts retain server/pane evidence; inbox attempts retain only
the resolved active recipient UUID and settle as `queued`, never `sent`.
`RequestService::enqueue` prepares the attempt, stores its exact prompt and
publishes recipient attention in one repository transaction. CLI inbox sends use
this path; pane effects retain the separate prepare/send/settle lifecycle.
Both paths reuse the same preparation and queue-transition policy. Database
errors roll back all enqueue writes. A recipient found inactive commits a failed,
non-waiting attempt without recipient attention, matching the prepared queue path.
Interrupting a sender after publication only releases its wait; it does not
retract queued recipient work.
The recipient revision is allocated atomically with the `queued` transition, so
a merely prepared attempt cannot wake a listener and every newly eligible item
advances that identity's shared participant sequence. Recipient request attention
is projected from the same attempt, while a final
written by another participant reuses the originator response attention.
`storage::requests` provides an indexed watermark and one bounded snapshot;
`exchange_command` owns the monotonic hard deadline and trailing debounce.
Listener polls perform no tmux inventory, retention cleanup, body scan or held
transaction, and introduce no daemon or event bus.

`reply_receipt` is the one maintained receipt codec. `response_command` and
`talk_command` compose it with the request service; neither adds a repository,
schema, connection or alternate final-submission path. Input is bounded and
validated before storage effects. A malformed receipt, a stale revision, an
unknown identity and an uncertain transport outcome remain distinct failures.

Talk preparation renders `<tmt-reply from="…">` using the same resolved
originator's display name (explicit identity before verified caller), or
`unknown`. The attribute is XML-escaped presentation, not authentication,
routing or a strict XML document. It introduces no extra identity lookup or
stored field; original message bytes, originator UUID/kind and reply correlation
remain owned by the existing request contract.

### Tmux and process effects

`tmt-adapters::process` is the shared bounded subprocess owner. It enforces
output caps, monotonic deadlines, process-group cleanup and wait/reap behavior.
Its owned running-command handle separates launch from wait when a caller needs
to release a selection lock; synchronous execution uses that same path. The
original deadline and cleanup ownership survive the split. An abandoned handle
stops and reaps its child without introducing a second runner or background task.
`interrupt::Interrupt` owns invocation-local signal callbacks and descriptor
cleanup. `tmux` uses explicit socket/server evidence, bounded command budgets,
owned buffers and no ambient host fallback. A failed paste or Enter is an
uncertain delivery and is never retried as if unsent.
Message delivery changes ASCII `!` to fullwidth `！` to avoid agent bash-mode
shortcuts; this is transport policy, not arbitrary output rewriting. `check`
remains bounded terminal diagnostics, not a fallback response channel.

`response_input` owns bounded file/stdin acquisition, regular-file checks,
nonblocking behavior and restoration of inherited descriptor flags. The public
CLI owns stdin during acquisition. These adapters do not invent background
threads or a second process runner.

## Managed skills and native installation

Managed agent guidance is a separate filesystem concern. The canonical
`tmux-team`, focused `tmt-inbox`, and optional `tmt-office` skills are embedded
as one versioned asset bundle by `skill_installation::assets`; digest-addressed
materialization, provider detection, target selection, links, backups, registry,
drift and lock handling live under
`rust/crates/tmt-adapters/src/skill_installation/`. Core install exposes only
`tmux-team` and `tmt-inbox`. Explicit Office install or upgrade exposes
`tmt-office` in detected provider roots and any custom root that still contains
an owned core skill. CLI upgrades refresh recorded Office links without creating
missing integrations. Core's `skill_provider::Provider` is the only provider
inventory. Skill installation does not open application configuration, SQLite
or tmux, and never silently replaces an unmanaged path.

Native executable installation is a different owner under
`tmt-adapters::native_install`:

Core's fixed `native_install::Product` policy owns CLI/Office package identity,
inventory and installation namespace; it has no filesystem or network effects.
The hidden offline installer accepts an explicit product (CLI by default), while
both products use the same acquisition, receipt and atomic publication path.
Office's command link, lock and current release are independent of the CLI's;
existing CLI receipts retain their format. Manifest selection uses product and
target together, rejecting ambiguous or multiply owned artifacts. This internal
path also serves public Office installation. `office_command` owns consent and
typed composition, not a second downloader. Default Office prefix is the user's
`.local`, independent of application configuration; `--prefix` selects another
owned installation. Public distribution and pairing remain separate gates.
GitHub selection filters CLI `v` and Office `tmt-office-v` tags independently.
Downloaded bytes feed the same bounded artifact verifier directly; there is no
extra download-to-disk/read-back stage. Before activating Office, publication
executes the bounded versioned probe and rejects incompatible candidates.
Removal validates ownership and deactivates links without deleting releases,
skills or application data. It is recoverable, not a multi-file atomic deletion:
a missing command link with a retained activation is reported as invalid and
explicit uninstall can finish that state.

- `artifact` consumes cargo-dist metadata and a matching archive, checking
  target, manifest membership, SHA-256, bounded compressed/expanded input,
  notices and executable contents;
- `publication` stages a release under an invocation-owned prefix, writes
  receipt/current/command links atomically under the installer lock, and keeps
  old owned releases until ownership and integrity checks permit cleanup;
- `receipt`, `release`, `managed` and `upgrade` implement local provenance,
  active-release inspection, channel/pin policy, verified HTTPS acquisition and
  forward-only activation;
- `native_install_command` and `native_upgrade_command` are thin CLI
  compositions. Application data and provider skills are separate owners.

The active executable is the authority for a managed update. Installer receipts
are anchored to the installation prefix/current executable, not to
`ConfigPaths.global_dir`; changing runtime config roots must not fabricate or
discard binary ownership evidence. Installation uses staged publication,
expected-current checks, explicit checkpoints and bounded cleanup. A failed
validation or cancellation leaves the previous current release and receipt
intact; a post-activation skill failure reports partial completion rather than
claiming an atomic application-wide transaction.

Public Office installation reports companion activation and optional skill
publication as separate outcomes: a guidance conflict never rolls back an
already activated companion or overwrites user content. `--force` authorizes a
recoverable target backup, not source replacement. Office deactivation retains
managed guidance; it does not silently remove an agent integration. The hidden
offline product installer remains binary-only.

The generated curl bootstrap is release tooling around this same native
installer. It derives archive facts from cargo-dist metadata and does not own a
second target catalog, archive parser, package manager, or production manifest.

## Testing and evidence boundaries

Retained tests are organized under `test/native/`, `test/e2e/`,
`test/tooling/` and `test/support/`, with Rust unit/integration tests beside
their owners. They use independent SQL/schema oracles for SQLite behavior and
frozen fixtures from `test/fixtures/storage-history/`; implementation reads
must not generate their own expected results. Native process tests use absolute
task-owned executables, bounded subprocesses and cleanup that stops, reaps and
only then removes fixture state. Signals are sent only to task-owned child
processes. No host tmux server, provider installation or global environment
mutation is test evidence.

`test/support/cli-process.ts` owns each native sandbox's active child runs;
descriptor clones share that lifetime. Direct-child exit starts same-group
cleanup even when descendants retain output pipes. Success requires direct
close and confirmed group absence; cleanup failure is bounded and retains
fixture files for diagnosis. Sandbox disposal cancels outstanding runs before
removing files. This is not containment of descendants that create new sessions,
and does not replace the separate Docker harness or release verifier.

The native process suite proves parser, configuration, identity, notes,
response, exchange, talk, installation and skill contracts through the real executable.
Docker E2E supplies private tmux, caller, lifecycle, transport and cross-process
evidence. Storage adapter tests prove migrations, transaction rollback,
contention, crash cleanup, retention, acknowledgment and late-final behavior.
Tooling tests prove release-script policy and bounded command wrappers; they do
not count as native runtime or release-archive proof.

Within Docker E2E, `cli-assertions.ts` owns the repeated strict success envelope
(zero exit, empty stderr, defined parsed JSON), not domain validation or command
execution. Scenario-specific payload projections and assertions stay local;
sharing a type must not turn required fields into optional ones. A different
stderr or parsing contract is not an interchangeable helper. The native-process
assertions in `test/support/cli-process.ts` retain their own process-result shape.

All public-command E2E scenarios use `test/support/cli-executable.mjs` through
the harness. There is no separate product-only native selector; explicit
`TMT_TEST_CLI`/peer descriptors still exercise override and nested-reply behavior.
`tmux-adapter` and `transport-adapter` deliberately select the test-only tmux
probe, not the public CLI. Their evidence cannot replace public command tests.
Feature ownership and deliberate overlap are mapped in DEVELOPMENT.md.

The six required runtime smoke environments are macOS x64/arm64, Linux glibc
x64/arm64 and Linux musl x64/arm64. Four raw native builds feed these checks;
the static Linux musl binaries are reused for both Linux environments. The
historical `Packed install (<environment>)` check names and
`Native package matrix` final blocking aggregator remain for CI
compatibility, but their step descriptions must identify them as native runtime
smoke checks, not npm-package checks. Smoke runs outside the checkout with
isolated HOME/state, no Node/Rust on the product PATH, exact embedded skill
checks, managed skill installation and SQLite reopen/persistence.

Executable selection is checked positively and negatively: a selected native executable
must run, and a missing default native build must fail clearly. No Rust coverage
percentage is compared with the retired TypeScript source or reported as a
zero-file success.

## Release boundary

`dist-workspace.toml`, `scripts/build-native-artifact.sh`,
`scripts/native-cargo.sh`, `scripts/native-artifact-policy.mjs` and
`scripts/verify-native-artifact.mjs` are developer/release tooling. The
workflow builds the four supported cargo-dist targets, creates target-filtered
third-party notices (including Vite's bundled frontend inventory for Office), and verifies runtime bytes, linkage, checksums, archive
inventory and executable behavior on matching hosts. CLI runs additionally
verify exact managed-skill contents and the generated bootstrap.

The release workflow remains an explicit product-selected preparation and
verification workflow; publication is separately authorized. CLI and Office
runs share the four-target cargo-dist build and archive verifier, while keeping
product-qualified bundles, independent versions and separate immutable tags.
Only the CLI bundle owns the generated `tmt-installer.sh` and managed-skill
bootstrap proof. Archives, their product-specific manifest/checksums and notices,
plus the CLI bootstrap where applicable, are verified before any public
publication. Raw PR executables do not prove cargo-dist archive correctness.
The runtime/linkage proof is shared through `scripts/native-runtime-proof.mjs`
and `scripts/verify-native-runtime.mjs`; do not reintroduce a second archive
builder or proof implementation.

## Maintenance contract

Update this map in the same change when responsibility, dependency direction,
command/error contracts, storage schema or lifecycle, trust boundaries,
resource ownership, shared test infrastructure or release evidence changes.
Keep a significant decision's alternatives, failure behavior and verification
plan in its issue and reflect the delivered boundary here. A green formatter or
checkmark is not architecture evidence.

Every change reports its architecture impact and names the affected Rust owner,
adapter, CLI composition and tests. New policy belongs in the existing owner;
do not add a parallel TypeScript implementation, provider inventory, config path
registry, release catalog, process runner, archive parser or memory/MCP layer.
