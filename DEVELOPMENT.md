# Development

The Rust workspace is the shipped CLI runtime. The nested `typescript` pnpm
workspace owns private developer tooling for Vitest, fixtures and release
verification; it is not an npm product or a CLI fallback. Repository policy is in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), architecture ownership in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
and style in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md). This guide holds the commands and
gates every change shares; per-area procedures live in the skills below.

## Setup

Requirements: Node.js 22.12 or newer, the pinned pnpm (through `corepack`) and the
toolchain in `rust/rust-toolchain.toml`. The workspace MSRV is Rust 1.95 and CI
also runs the pinned release toolchain. Remote-client tests need `python3` for the
independent byte-fixture oracle, shell completion tests need Bash and Zsh, and
runtime proof needs the macOS developer tools or Linux `readelf`.

```bash
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd rust && rustup show)
```

pnpm commands in this repository run from `typescript/` unless a command changes
directory; Cargo and Docker commands run from the repository root. Use the
pinned pnpm lockfile, not another package manager. `better-sqlite3` is a
development-only independent SQLite oracle, never a reason to reopen native
schema state through Node.

Never install the product globally while testing. Keep application state,
provider directories, prefixes, sockets and child processes inside a task-owned
temporary root.

## Keep local development from filling the disk

Docker's build cache and image tags, and one Cargo `target` per worktree, are the
largest waste. Before a Docker suite run the read-only check; it prints free
space (warning below `TMT_DISK_WARN_GB`, default 30) and `docker system df`, and
deletes nothing:

```sh
scripts/dev-disk-check.sh
```

Below the threshold, stop and tell the maintainer. Delete only what you created,
and never restart Docker Desktop.

- **One image tag per worktree.** Name every local verification image after the
  worktree so a rerun replaces it; a tag never names a PR or issue:

  ```sh
  worktree=$(printf %s "$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")" | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | tr -c 'a-z0-9_.-' '-')
  docker build -t "tmt-performance:$worktree" ...   # <purpose>:$worktree
  ```

  `pnpm test:e2e` already uses a per-run tag and removes it on exit.

- **Prune the build cache about once a day of use.** It removes only cache older
  than 24 hours; no other `docker ... prune` is part of this workflow:

  ```sh
  docker builder prune --filter until=24h -f
  ```

- **Each worktree keeps its own `rust/target`.** Native selectors,
  `scripts/tmt-dev.sh` and the Docker fixtures read `rust/target/debug/...`, and a
  shared directory would run another worktree's binary. Never point
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at `/tmp` or elsewhere. Reuse a clean worktree instead of
  adding one: `git status --short` empty and the branch pushed or merged, then
  `git fetch origin` and `git switch -c <new-branch> origin/main`.
- **Remove a worktree when its PR merges**, in the same turn, with the script
  that checks it is safe:

  ```sh
  scripts/dev-worktree-remove.sh <worktree-path> <pr-number>
  ```

  It removes the worktree and prunes only when `git status --short` prints
  nothing **and** either the PR is merged (REST `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>`
  has a non-null `merged_at`) or the branch has an upstream and `git log @{u}..`
  prints nothing. Open, closed-unmerged and failed PR lookups require the
  upstream proof, which alone is not enough after a server-side rebase. If the
  script refuses, stop and ask the maintainer: a refusal is not permission to
  remove the worktree by hand, with `--force`, or by deleting the branch.
  Only after it succeeds, remove that worktree's images
  (`docker image rm "<purpose>:$worktree"`; never-built images are skipped).

## Run the workspace CLI

```bash
(cd rust && cargo build --locked -p tmt-cli)
sh scripts/tmt-dev.sh --version
(cd rust && cargo build --locked -p tmt-squad)
./rust/target/debug/tmt-squad --help
```

`scripts/tmt-dev.sh` and `pnpm tmt` launch only this checkout's
`rust/target/debug/tmt`: they never build, install or fall back to a global
binary, so rebuild after changing Rust sources. For clean JSON stdout use
`(cd typescript && corepack pnpm --silent tmt ...)`. Normal commands still use
the usual application data unless you select isolated settings. Extension
executables resolve core lookups through `TMT_EXECUTABLE` (set when TMT invokes
them) or an executable `tmt` on `PATH`.

Contracts: [local process API](contracts/extension-api.md) for extensions and the
[MCP contract](contracts/mcp-v1.md). Native MCP tests, from `rust/`:
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test --offline --locked -p tmt-adapters mcp::tests` and
`... -p tmt-cli --test mcp`; they need no provider credentials or tmux.

## Rust checks

Run from `rust/` for a normal native change:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
cargo build --locked
cargo build --locked --example storage-probe
cargo build --locked --example tmux-probe
cargo +1.95.0 build --locked
```

Use `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` on shared machines.

**Product builds are package-scoped.** Workspace and combined builds unify
dependency features, so their `tmt` can differ from the product's. Identity proofs
compare `cargo build --locked --release -p tmt-cli` alone, at the same checkout
path, before and after a change. Build the native-test fixtures separately,
after workspace checks, with `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0 cargo build --locked -p
tmt-cli` (no debug symbols, but debug assertions stay on). Every Cargo build stage
in Docker contexts must copy all workspace member directories at their
workspace-relative paths; `docker-workspace.test.ts` checks it.

**ETXTBSY.** A fixture that writes an executable and runs it can fail with
"Text file busy": another test thread's `fork` holds a copy of the write
descriptor until the child's `exec`. Production code never retries it. Pick the
rule by who writes and who runs:

- The test writes a script and controls how it runs: run `/bin/sh <script>`.
- The test writes a stand-in something else execs by path (a fake `tmt` or `tmux`
  on `PATH`): publish it with the dev-only
  `tmt-test-support::write_executable(path, bytes, mode)` (short-lived `sh`
  writer, cleared environment, thirty-second bound, no retries; keep the 0700 or
  0755 mode).
- The product writes then execs (an installer and its verifier): wait out the
  window with a bounded retry of only that error in the fixture.

In `typescript/test`, publish every written executable or interpreted fixture
through `test/support/executable-fixture.mjs` (`writeExecutable`); synthetic
installers use its `--write FILE MODE` entry point. Never replace malformed
fixture bytes, add ETXTBSY retries or extend deadlines. For publication and
dependency changes also run `cargo test --locked -p tmt-test-support` and the
architecture test, which checks the exact dev consumers of the support crate.

**Snapshots.** `insta` snapshots live beside their tests (for example
`rust/crates/tmt-cli-style/tests/snapshots/`). After an intended change run
`INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo test -p <crate>`, delete leftover `*.snap.new` files and
review the diff. CI never updates snapshots.

**CLI style and printed-command guards** ([enforcement](design/cli-style.md#enforcement))
run in `cargo test`. When a migrated command leaves its list, run them directly:
`cargo test --locked -p tmt-cli --bin tmt cli_style` and
`cargo test --locked -p tmt-squad cli_style`; a failure prints the list entry to
add or remove. When adding or changing a printed command template, update its
presentation site's test-only `HintSpec` list (explicit command boundaries,
representative operands, and a reason for any external-command skip); the guard
parses without executing and fails on missing and stale samples.

**Architecture guard.** Part of `cargo test`; a focused offline run:

```bash
cargo test --offline --locked --manifest-path /absolute/checkout/rust/Cargo.toml --test architecture
cargo +1.95.0 test --offline --locked --manifest-path /absolute/checkout/rust/Cargo.toml --test architecture
```

Run it on every Rust push: it enforces workspace-unique names, dependency
direction and the reviewed dev edges. When changing a guard, exercise a real
positive and negative source or dependency fixture and restore the checkout
exactly; a stale lockfile or an unexecuted test is not evidence. Core stays free
of concrete I/O, adapters own SQLite/files/processes, the CLI owns grammar and
composition.

The adapter `process::cleanup_policy_tests` must pass under both `cargo test` and
nextest. Driver, runtime, completion and request-ID checks are in
[tmt-dev's focused checks](.agents/skills/tmt-dev/reference/focused-checks.md).

## Native process and shared tests

JavaScript suites live under `typescript/test/{native,e2e,tooling,support}/`; Rust
tests stay beside their owner in `rust/crates/*`.

**Isolation.** Fixtures clear the parent environment. HOME, XDG config/data/state/
cache, `CODEX_HOME`, temporary files and the tmux socket directory stay under the
fixture's owned root, and state uses the canonical XDG `tmux-team` directory. They
inherit no caller/provider markers, recursion flags or color settings.
`tmt-cli/tests/support` owns this for Rust process tests. Native TypeScript
`runCli` also isolates CLI ancestry through
`rust/crates/tmt-adapters/examples/runtime-caller-fixture.rs`
([testing boundaries](ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-and-evidence-boundaries)); build it
before tooling or native tests, as CI does:

```bash
cargo build --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p tmt-adapters --example runtime-caller-fixture
```

**Selecting the CLI.** The native selector resolves `rust/target/debug/tmt` and
fails if it is absent. An explicit descriptor may select another absolute
executable; neither an installed host command nor Node is a fallback, and paths
and argv are data, never shell fragments:

```bash
cargo build --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml
cargo build --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --example storage-probe
TMT_TEST_CLI='{"executable":"/abs/rust/target/debug/tmt","args":[]}' \
TMT_TEST_STORAGE_PROBE='{"executable":"/abs/rust/target/debug/examples/storage-probe","args":[]}' \
  pnpm test:native
```

The suite needs a Git checkout and Cargo: version expectations read `cargo
metadata --no-deps --offline --locked`, `rust/Cargo.lock` and `git ls-files -z`
once per suite. Native Rust CI selects the same-checkout release CLI; local
selection defaults to the debug build.

**Fixture builds belong in the process job itself.** Process and archive fixtures
need the CLI and Herdr together (`cargo build --locked -p tmt-cli -p
tmt-driver-herdr --bins`); extension archive scenarios also need `tmt-squad`,
`tmt-remote` and `tmt-colab`, and Colab's verifier needs `cargo build --locked -p
tmt-test-support --example colab-runtime-fixture`. Another job's build or a warm
local target does not supply them.

**Rules.**

- Prove the missing-native negative control and the selected-native positive
  control. Child processes are finite, stopped and reaped before fixture deletion,
  and signalled only when task-owned. Never use host tmux, global provider state or
  process-wide environment mutation as setup.
- A settled or deleted batch is not process completion: retain each detached
  worker's exact process incarnation and confirm its exit in scenario cleanup.
- Use `withSandbox` for callback-owned fixtures. Disposal stops outstanding
  commands before deleting files; an unconfirmed process group is never signalled,
  and unconfirmed cleanup fails and reports the retained fixture path instead of
  deleting possibly live state. Lifecycle regressions live in
  `test/tooling/cli-process.test.ts`. On Linux a post-callback cwd guard fails on
  resident processes; it is skipped on macOS.
- Frozen migration fixtures and provenance under
  `typescript/test/fixtures/storage-history/` are immutable evidence: never
  generate expected data with the implementation under test. For schema changes
  update `typescript/test/native/storage-fixture.ts` and the explicit
  migration/table assertions, then run the complete process suite; Rust storage
  tests do not replace process-level migration and future-version rejection.
- Tooling tests: `(cd typescript && corepack pnpm exec vp test run --config vitest.config.ts test/tooling)`.

Herdr, provider-contract, load and performance checks are in
[tmt-e2e](.agents/skills/tmt-e2e/SKILL.md).

## Docker E2E

Run the full private tmux and caller lifecycle harness twice for lifecycle,
transport, identity, talk or cleanup changes:

```bash
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm test:e2e)
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm test:e2e)
```

`TMT_E2E_FILES="squad.e2e.test.ts"` (space-separated plain file names) limits the
run; the image anchors each name as `test/e2e/<name>` because vitest filters by
substring. `TMT_E2E_ADAPTER_TESTS=0` skips the Rust adapter tests, and a host
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` (a positive count or `default`) limits the image's builds. CI
runs two shards behind the required `Docker E2E` gate, balanced by
`typescript/test/e2e/shard-weights.json` through `typescript/scripts/e2e-shards.mjs`
(refresh weights from a full run when shards drift; a guard fails if a scenario is
in no shard or two).

The harness builds its pinned image with `--network none`, private tmux sockets
and deterministic mock agents, and must not reach a host tmux server or a real
agent. The wrapper's `--init` is part of orphan-child cleanup evidence. The image
places its binary at `rust/target/debug/tmt` and leaves the selector unset, so it
exercises the developer default path. Scenario ownership and harness rules are in
[tmt-e2e](.agents/skills/tmt-e2e/SKILL.md).

Ordinary developer checks:

```bash
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm check)
(cd typescript && corepack pnpm test:run)
```

`pnpm check` is the quality entrypoint for all retained tooling (`pnpm type:check`,
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check` run its parts); `pnpm docs:format:check` covers
docs. Neither replaces the Rust commands, the native process suite or Docker runs.

## Installed guidance source ownership

`skills/tmux-team/SKILL.md` and `skills/tmt-inbox/SKILL.md` are the canonical
installed guidance, one versioned bundle; core install exposes only these. Edit the
single canonical file; never add provider-specific copies. Verify exact embedded
bytes, managed links, repeat no-op, backup/conflict and partial-failure behavior,
lock ownership and no effects on SQLite or tmux. `test/native/legacy-extension-skills.test.ts`
owns the legacy-bundle regressions, `skill_installation::owned_tests` the
extension-owned skills, and every fixture uses the isolated HOME/config sandbox.
Provider and custom-root usage: [Settings chapter](site/src/chapters/settings.mdx)
and `skills/README.md`. The squad lead skill
(`extensions/tmt-squad/skills/tmt-squad/SKILL.md`) and playbooks are embedded by the
squad executable and sit outside this bundle (see
[tmt-squad-dev](.agents/skills/tmt-squad-dev/SKILL.md)).

## Project tracking

Progress is read from the `pj-tmt` project
(<https://github.com/orgs/pj-tmt/projects/1>), filtered to `label:epic`. Each epic
has one tracker issue titled `Epic: <name>` with the `epic` label; the project's
Sub-issues progress counts only direct sub-issues, so the tracker is the only
parent that matters.

Every issue carries these Project fields:

- `Epic`: the tracker it serves; the issue is also its direct sub-issue. Umbrella
  or findings-log issues stay outside the tracker.
- `Squad`: the squad whose lead owns the issue.
- `Status`: `Todo` (not started); `In Progress` (implementation started, including
  draft or stacked PRs); `In Review` (a PR is ready or queued; in a stacked chain
  while any PR is queued); `Merged` (the last required PR is on `main` and a
  release is pending; a `Fixes #N` merge sets it); `Released` (every affected
  product has a published tag containing the closing merge commits; release
  automation sets it and fills `Released in`); `Done` (closed without a delivering
  merged PR, delivery confined to never-shipped leaves, or only parked-product waits;
  release automation sets it).
- `Agents`: comma-separated agents actively building or coordinating it now, lead
  first; reviewers who build nothing are not listed. Removing a member from
  `Agents` is part of its retirement checklist.

Tracker rules:

- One owning lead per tracker, recorded in `Squad`. On a shared tracker the owner
  writes its Status and body; each child keeps the Status and Agents of the lead
  whose member works on it.
- The body keeps a three-to-six-line `Now / Next / Blocked` section, outcome first
  with issue numbers in parentheses, plus one `Try it` command when something is
  runnable. Update it on merge, member start or retirement, or a blocker. Logs and
  evidence stay in child issues and PRs.
- Tracker Status is `In Progress` while any child is active, `Todo` when nothing
  has started or the feature is parked (say "parked" in `Now`), `Merged` when all
  required delivery is on `main`, and `Released` only after publication and any
  acceptance or dogfood gate. Keep pending gates under `Blocked`; optional future
  children must not reopen a delivered milestone.
- A tracker is a product item the maintainer set: a lead may propose one through
  tmt-lead and no agent creates one on its own. Below a tracker, leads and the
  project manager open child issues freely: one outcome with acceptance criteria
  and normally one reviewable PR; split a child that hides progress across PRs or
  squads.
- The project manager runs one batched pass per hour
  ([PM procedure](.agents/skills/tmt-pm/SKILL.md)); leads add event-driven updates.
  Batch Project edits, never poll, and keep to about 200 GraphQL calls per lead
  per day: the GraphQL limit is shared by every agent on the maintainer's account.

## Review and evidence

Before handoff, report the changed owner, run the smallest relevant focused tests,
then the complete gates the issue requires:

1. `pnpm check` and retained tooling tests;
2. Rust fmt, clippy, locked tests, build and MSRV build;
3. the complete native process suite with its missing-native negative and
   selected-native positive controls;
4. two complete Docker E2E runs for lifecycle or transport changes;
5. available real-host smoke environments, the rest left to the required CI matrix;
6. matching-host artifact and bootstrap proofs for release changes.

Never turn a filtered, skipped, cross-compiled or failed subprocess into a success
claim. Preserve exact bytes and independent oracles, keep returned errors distinct
from crash recovery, and retain uncertainty, transaction, retention,
acknowledgment, lifetime and cleanup evidence when changing those boundaries.
Compare exact file bytes, not symlink-directory snapshots or enumerated binary
objects; use structured output or a focused formatter test, not mocked
`console.log`. Test design belongs to [CONVENTIONS](CONVENTIONS.md#tests-and-review),
isolation and evidence ownership to
[ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-and-evidence-boundaries); apply the
[architecture maintenance contract](ARCHITECTURE.md#maintenance-contract) when
changing an owner, boundary or verification procedure.
