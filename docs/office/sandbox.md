# Data-only Office sandbox

Status: proposed data-only sandbox; no authoring, exploration or assignment APIs
are shipped. [Architecture](architecture.md)
describes current behavior; [commands](commands.md) owns proposed CLI syntax.

## Boundary

Office is an optional TMT extension. Community content inside Office is data,
not another executable plugin system. A prop authoring API accepts declarative
pixel data, palette indices, dimensions and bounded metadata. It never accepts
scripts, shaders, HTML, arbitrary SVG, external asset URLs, prompts, tool calls
or behavior hooks. Only the trusted renderer interprets a supported schema.
The existing curated SVG primitives are repository code, not permission to
upload SVG. No runtime SDK, marketplace or general plugin loader is needed.

Authoring, world admission and placement are separate operations:

1. Validate and preview a candidate; identify an immutable version by verified
   content. Updating a prop creates a new version, not changed bytes at an old ID.
2. A world owner explicitly admits that version to the world's available catalog.
   Visiting or discovering a prop never installs or authorizes it automatically.
3. An assigned agent may place admitted props within its block's bounds and
   object budget. Layout revisions retain the existing conditional-write policy.

Removing a catalog entry prevents new placement. Existing references remain
identifiable; unavailable or unsupported assets render a bounded placeholder,
without fetching arbitrary URLs or breaking the room. Clearing placed objects
is a separate explicit layout edit. Distribution, referenced-asset retention
and garbage collection must be specified before storage implementation.

The fixed four-asset [home block v1](../../contracts/office/block-v1.md) remains
unchanged. Custom props need a versioned successor contract, not permissive
fallback decoding or a parallel layout copy. Before implementation, fix numeric
byte/dimension/palette/catalog quotas, identifier and digest format, schema,
storage paths, access rules and operation costs. Shared independent conformance
vectors must cover the renderer, native input and authoritative write boundary;
do not assume Firestore Rules can validate arbitrary artwork cheaply.

## Exploration without execution

Exploration returns structured, permission-filtered world/block observations,
available prop versions, geometry and allowed operations. It does not move an
agent, start a session, install content or grant work authority. A map is a
permitted projection, not an unrestricted world directory. Report observation
age and unknown/offline states rather than inventing live presence. Query scope,
pagination and listener counts must be bounded before these endpoints ship.

Capability descriptions come from trusted TMT schemas. Community names, pixels
and metadata are untrusted data even after shape validation; visual text can
still contain prompt injection. Initially omit free-form instructions and
behavior descriptions, constrain labels/control characters and separate their
origin in output. Never interpolate community text into system notices or
agent instructions. A data sandbox reduces execution risk; it does not make
all content safe for an already-privileged model to obey.

## Identity, assignment and decoration

Reuse local TMT identity UUIDs; do not create a second agent registry. A world
owns its blocks, and a scoped assignment permits a particular device/local
identity to edit a selected block. Both temporary and saved identities qualify.
Names, pane titles and folders are never authority. Assignment is separate from
publishing a remote work capability.

| Event                                         | Assignment and block result                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Temporary identity conclusively retires       | End assignment authority; retain decoration as unassigned space   |
| Saved identity is offline                     | Retain assignment, but do not claim current availability          |
| New identity reuses a display name            | No inherited assignment or credentials                            |
| Owner reassigns the block                     | Fence the former grant; preserve layout unless explicitly cleared |
| Local evidence or connectivity is unavailable | Report unknown; never treat uncertainty as proof of retirement    |

Do not create an enduring block automatically for every temporary identity.
Start with explicit owner assignment; self-service seats and capacity policy are
later work. The server cannot instantly observe a disconnected local pane.
Before device writes ship, specify principal-to-identity binding, finite lease
duration/renewal, revocation checks and stale-writer fencing. Local commands must
reject retired identities; server authorization must expire without trusting
the client to report retirement. Lease expiry suspends authority, not decoration
retention, and is not proof that an agent died. TTL physical deletion is not an
authorization mechanism. One-shot edits should not require a resident connector;
define bounded grant renewal before promising that experience.

## Trusted contextual notices

Optional notices announce local identity creation, newly assigned space or
changed access; they are event-driven, not random prompts or cloud broadcasts.
Deduplicate by immutable local identity and event revision, not display name.
Use locally known state with no per-command Firestore lookup. User configuration
can disable advisory notices; required command errors still report normally.

Never modify reply bodies, files, receipts or exact command payloads. Human-mode
advisories may use stderr; JSON stdout retains the existing native envelope.
Any future structured notice field needs one reviewed output contract before
implementation. Use fixed trusted wording and safe identifiers, not community
prose. Advertising an assignment is not authorization to install, pair or spend
model tokens. Update the canonical installed skill only with actual commands.

## Acceptance gates for implementation slices

- Reject executable/unknown fields, external references, malformed palette or
  pixels, oversized inputs and unauthorized/cross-block writes; retain positive
  controls at full supported capacity.
- Prove immutable-version verification, unsupported/missing-asset placeholders
  and independent durable layout results, not a renderer-only mock.
- Exercise temporary retirement, saved/offline identity, same-name replacement,
  reassignment, lease expiry and disconnected stale writers.
- Prove exploration has no installation, execution or unauthorized disclosure
  effects; measure bounded reads/writes rather than per-frame synchronization.
- Test notice deduplication, disabled mode, control-character handling, zero
  added network lookups and byte-identical JSON/payload output.

Authoring depends on verified installation, scoped pairing and fixed-catalog
agent decoration. Social chat, arbitrary runtimes, remote work, guest federation
and production deployment are outside this sandbox.
