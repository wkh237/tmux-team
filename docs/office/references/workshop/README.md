# Workshop visual reference

These retained interaction concepts are not product screenshots or proof that a
feature exists. The [visual reference index](../rooms-and-walls/README.md)
owns the current wall-free platform direction; the older illustrations do not
define geometry or editor modes. The
[functional-extension contract](../../../../contracts/office/functional-props.md)
owns behavior; this reference set owns visual intent.

Preserve honey-oak floors, deep teal structure, cream panels, moss textiles,
terracotta seating and rich readable pixel-art furniture. Uniform room shells
and simplified/static lighting are acceptable. A flat dashboard or geometric
placeholder artwork is not visual alignment.
Platform geometry and structural finish follow the current visual reference
index, not the high walls and doorways in these older interaction illustrations.

Interactive objects deliberately stand out from decoration: contrasting sci-fi
teal docking outlines and high-contrast action markers are welcome against
the warm room. They remain visible before hover; focus reveals a clear action
label. Keep pixel edges crisp and the idle scene still. The
[interaction contract](../../../../contracts/office/functional-props.md#interaction-affordance)
owns availability and input behavior; this is not permission to imply unsupported
actions with decorative lights or badges.

HUD overlays never shrink or refit the world. Selection opens one contextual
inspector; closing restores the office. Desktop/narrow layouts retain keyboard
access and readable controls. Incidental mock labels, counts, character limits,
decorative rooms and sample conversations are not domain requirements.
Recipient modes are exclusive; unread indicators require real read-state support.
Appearance and object properties share that inspector position, not simultaneous
sidebars. The images' Arrange and Save controls are historical, not requirements
for the current editing flow. Functional actions retain an equivalent accessible
entry outside the spatial renderer.

Generated with the built-in imagegen tool. These are documentation assets, not
runtime scene textures. Superseded overview artwork and generation transcripts
are not part of the current reference set.

## Whiteboard artwork

The [generated whiteboard source](whiteboard-source-v1.png) supplies the textured
oak frame, metal joints, marker tray and four upright views. The runtime uses the
[indexed v2 pack](../../../../contracts/office/whiteboard-props-v2.tmtprop.json),
not a geometric placeholder or the source image. Its resource binding, footprint
and host-drawn interaction cues remain separate from the art. See the
[prompt and mechanical compilation notes](whiteboard-art-prompt.md).

## Broadcaster artwork

[Generated source](broadcaster-sprite-source-v1.png) supplies four directional
views of an oak-and-teal microphone station. It was generated with the built-in
imagegen tool, then mechanically downsampled and palette-indexed into the runtime
[v2 pack](../../../../contracts/office/broadcaster-props-v2.tmtprop.json), four
64×64 frames. The image contains appearance only; the host adds action cues.
The prompt requested: "A transparent four-view pixel-art sprite sheet for a warm
office broadcast station: oak cabinet, dark teal control panel, mint display,
speaker grille, brass knobs and gooseneck microphone. South, west, north, east
views; consistent scale; no text, UI, people or room background."

## Study furniture artwork

The [study pack](../../../../contracts/office/study-furniture-v2.tmtprop.json)
adds a bookcase, reading lamp and desktop terminal without changing earlier
immutable packs. Each has four upright South/West/North/East frames at eight
source pixels per tile. The sources were generated with the built-in imagegen
tool, then mechanically downsampled and palette-indexed together; runtime uses
247 palette entries and 141,789 source bytes, not the original large images.

- [Bookcase source](bookcase-source-v1.png): honey oak, three shelves of warm
  colored books, bottom cupboard and trailing plant; 96 × 96 pixels per view.
- [Reading lamp source](reading-lamp-source-v1.png): moss enamel shade, brass
  stand and dark teal base; 64 × 64 pixels per view. Its light is baked artwork,
  not a dynamic lighting effect or an interactive capability.
- [Desktop terminal source](desktop-terminal-source-v1.png): teal monitor,
  cream keyboard and mouse; 48 × 48 pixels per view. It is decoration, not a
  terminal executor. Like other furniture, it receives no functional action badge.

The [generation prompts](study-art-prompts.md) retain the final prompt set.
The local furniture palette composes these admitted packs; the empty-room starter
uses the same placement records as individual Add actions. It is an editable
suggestion, never an automatic replacement for an existing room.

## Detailed robot artwork

The [generated source](robot-source-v2.png) is mechanically reduced to the
[32×48 v2 robot pack](../../../../contracts/office/workshop-robot-v2.tmtavatar.json).
The runtime consumes its 133-entry indexed palette, not the large PNG. Native
pack validation and browser admission accept the same file. Source alpha is
normalized to the format's transparent/opaque cells without a backdrop.

Stored appearance choices tint named shell/body palette slots; accessory
silhouettes are composited on their existing two-pixel grid. Fixed visor, eyes,
brass joints and chest label remain separate. These defaults do not override
installed custom avatar references. See [source prompts](robot-art-prompts.md).
