# tmux-team

Your coding agents, working together. Send work to a tmux pane by name, get
complete replies, and recover outstanding tasks without digging through terminal
history. A standalone native CLI—no Node.js, Rust toolchain, or daemon required.

## Install

Native alpha for macOS and Linux, arm64 and x64. No Node, npm, pnpm or Rust
toolchain needed.

[Download the installer](https://github.com/wkh237/tmux-team/releases/download/v5.0.0-alpha.4/tmt-installer.sh),
then run it from the download folder:

```sh
sh tmt-installer.sh
```

Installs into `~/.local/bin` and sets up the agent skill non-interactively.
If `tmt` is not found, complete the [one-time PATH setup](NATIVE-INSTALL.md#one-time-path-setup).
Reload your agent's skills. Update later with `tmt upgrade`—no reinstall or
repeated PATH setup.

Prefer curl, a custom location, or replacing an older installation? See
[installation options](NATIVE-INSTALL.md). The installer never uninstalls old
packages or deletes application data.

tmux is needed for live pane operations: binding, direct pane messaging and
inspection. Explicit local identity/profile access, stored results, and the
opt-in `talk --inbox` queue with bounded `x listen` work without it. Inbox
delivery stores work locally; it does not wake or run an agent, add a background
service, or provide remote transport.

## Quick start

For the receiving agent, start a tmux session if needed:

```bash
tmux new -s tmt
```

Name the target pane from its shell, then launch your agent:

```bash
tmt name reviewer
gemini
```

From another terminal or tmux pane on the same machine (the sender need not be
inside tmux):

```bash
tmt talk reviewer "Review the current changes and report concrete risks."
```

The receiving agent's skill explains how to submit its complete reply. `talk`
waits for that stored reply, not terminal markers or idle output. Use
`--detach` to return immediately and `tmt result <request-id>` to collect it later.

Names are global, not folder-scoped. Pane identities are temporary by default;
use `tmt name reviewer -s` to save one. `tmt ls` shows lifetime and presence.
`tmt rm reviewer` removes a temporary identity; saved removal requires `--force`.
Neither removal nor unbinding kills the pane.

## Recover outstanding work

A saved originator identity lets you recover requests after timeout, detach or
pane loss, including when the caller is outside tmux:

```bash
tmt identity create coordinator
tmt talk reviewer "Run the agreed checks." --identity coordinator --detach --json
tmt x --identity coordinator --json
tmt x show <request-id> --identity coordinator --json
tmt x ackall --identity coordinator --json
```

Reads never acknowledge results. `ackall` marks the current snapshot handled;
a later reply appears again. Acknowledgment neither cancels work nor asserts success.

## Keep local notes for a saved identity

Initialize and print an identity-owned Markdown path with:

```bash
tmt notes path --identity coordinator
```

Inside a verified saved-identity pane, `--identity` may be omitted. The file is
kept under TMT's local state by identity UUID, so pane loss, renaming a tmux
window, or working offline does not move it. Temporary identities are rejected.
TMT creates an empty private file on first use and never overwrites later edits.

## One skill, no plugin

`tmt install` supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, agy, Pi and OpenCode. If none
is detected, it installs the shared skill. Use `tmt install --dir <skills-root>`
for another discovery folder. No plugin or separate `/team` command is needed;
Claude Code can invoke the skill as `/tmux-team`.

For an existing conversation, ask the agent to read `tmt learn --skill` after
updating. Installation does not reload a running agent. See the
[provider guide](skills/README.md) and [canonical skill](skills/tmux-team/SKILL.md).

## Boundaries worth knowing

Direct delivery routes to live panes on the current tmux server and remains the
primary path when the recipient is reachable. For explicit asynchronous local
delivery, `tmt talk <identity> "message" --inbox` queues to an existing
non-retired identity in local SQLite; the recipient uses bounded `tmt x listen`
and `tmt x show --incoming` commands to discover and inspect it. This does not
add a daemon, remote routing, shared memory, authentication, MCP connectivity,
or an Office dependency.

Your tmux titles and border layout stay untouched. Badges are off by default;
see [optional pane badges](USER-GUIDE.md#optional-pane-badge). Inspect settings
with `tmt config show --json`.

ASCII `!` becomes fullwidth `！` in delivered messages to protect coding-agent
shell shortcuts. If delivery becomes uncertain, inspect before retrying; a
timeout alone is not permission to resend.

See the [user guide](USER-GUIDE.md) for notes, roles, preambles, configuration
and failure handling, or `tmt help` for command options.

## Development

Office is an optional work in progress. An independently versioned public alpha
companion is available through `tmt office install --yes` for pairing and remote
agent block decoration with scoped, renewable access. This source tree additionally
implements offline local block editing through `tmt office start`, but it is not in
the currently published CLI/Office pair and must be released together before public
installer guidance may claim it. The local UI is loopback-only, uses the same SQLite
repository as one-shot `--local` commands and needs no Node or Firebase at runtime;
no hosted Office service is provided. See
[Office commands](docs/office/commands.md); ordinary TMT use does not require it.

Contributor-only requirements and checks are in [development](DEVELOPMENT.md).
See [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for runtime and test ownership.
